      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:30.72" id="p0" end="00:00:34.24">In the great Tree of Life,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:34.24" id="p1" end="00:00:39.88">one branch of the mammals has a<br />particular fascination for us,<br />for we belong to it.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:42.56" id="p2" end="00:00:44.08">Primates.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:52.32" id="p3" end="00:00:56.04">Primate hands provide a firm grip.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:56.04" id="p4" end="00:01:00.68">And forward facing eyes<br />accurately assess distance.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:06.32" id="p5" end="00:01:10.80">Both are crucial for a lifestyle<br />that began in the trees.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:17.40" id="p6" end="00:01:22.96">Intelligence among primates<br />can excel that of all other animals.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:29.28" id="p7" end="00:01:32.16">Primates can solve<br />difficult problems...</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:34.04" id="p8" end="00:01:36.48">..develop thoughts and ideas...</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:38.92" id="p9" end="00:01:42.00">..and build<br />long-lasting relationships.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:44.80" id="p10" end="00:01:50.80">But most importantly,<br />primates remember<br />what they learn during their lives.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:52.96" id="p11" end="00:02:00.96">This film reveals how intelligence<br />helps our closest relatives to<br />tackle the many challenges of life.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:30.64" id="p12" end="00:02:34.84">There are more than<br />350 primate species on Earth.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:41.00" id="p13" end="00:02:46.40">Since they first appeared over<br />65 million years ago,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:46.40" id="p14" end="00:02:51.72">these clever animals have become<br />adapted to an<br />extraordinary range of habitats.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:57.12" id="p15" end="00:03:00.56">The Awash region<br />of southern Ethiopia.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:05.48" id="p16" end="00:03:09.00">A harsh, remote scrubland.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:14.92" id="p17" end="00:03:19.04">But primates have learned<br />how to make it their home.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:30.68" id="p18" end="00:03:36.12">Hamadryas baboons are waking up from<br />a night spent high on the cliffs.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:40.48" id="p19" end="00:03:47.72">These monkeys live in groups<br />up to four hundred strong,<br />with no single leader.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:47.72" id="p20" end="00:03:55.36">Theirs is a very complex society,<br />made up of dozens of small harems,<br />each governed by a male.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:58.08" id="p21" end="00:04:02.48">Every morning they leave the safety<br />of the cliffs to find food.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:12.80" id="p22" end="00:04:15.92">Top-ranking males lead the way.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:18.00" id="p23" end="00:04:22.80">They can be very severe with<br />their females if there is<br />the slightest misdemeanour.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:40.40" id="p24" end="00:04:46.84">Despite their individual strength,<br />hamadryas baboons prefer<br />to travel as a troop.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:46.84" id="p25" end="00:04:48.92">It's safer that way.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:01.04" id="p26" end="00:05:05.80">On this particular morning,<br />something stops them<br />in their tracks.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:14.44" id="p27" end="00:05:19.08">Another troop<br />is using these cliffs as a barracks.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:29.20" id="p28" end="00:05:32.56">More than a thousand<br />baboons can overnight here.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:32.56" id="p29" end="00:05:35.68">And a rival faction<br />is heading directly their way.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:05.92" id="p30" end="00:06:10.48">In the chaos of warfare,<br />males settle old scores.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:17.08" id="p31" end="00:06:21.52">This is also their best chance<br />of stealing females.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:52.40" id="p32" end="00:06:56.24">When the fighting is over,<br />the harems reform.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:01.16" id="p33" end="00:07:06.60">Lead males punish any of their<br />females who had dared to stray.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:19.20" id="p34" end="00:07:24.24">Strict discipline is essential<br />if order is to be maintained.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:35.44" id="p35" end="00:07:38.60">It's a harsh social system</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:38.60" id="p36" end="00:07:43.88">but it works for hamadryas baboons<br />here on these arid plains.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:51.72" id="p37" end="00:07:56.04">In other parts of the world,<br />primates have had to organise</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:56.04" id="p38" end="00:08:01.44">their societies in a different way<br />to cope with different challenges.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:05.84" id="p39" end="00:08:09.72">Mid-winter in the Japanese Alps.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:13.32" id="p40" end="00:08:19.40">The Kamicoche Valley is the haunt of<br />the most northerly-dwelling monkeys.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:26.40" id="p41" end="00:08:33.20">To live here you must be able to<br />survive temperatures which plunge<br />to minus 20 centigrade.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:44.28" id="p42" end="00:08:46.96">The Japanese macaque.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:57.24" id="p43" end="00:09:04.32">Dense thick layers of fur<br />help to insulate these snow moneys<br />in this testing environment.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:09.16" id="p44" end="00:09:12.20">But they still feel the cold.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:19.88" id="p45" end="00:09:23.04">At this time of the year<br />food is scarce.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:27.08" id="p46" end="00:09:30.76">But macaques are adaptable and<br />clever.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:36.56" id="p47" end="00:09:42.80">The troop has learnt that this<br />river stays ice-free the year round.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:47.00" id="p48" end="00:09:51.00">This female knows it's a good<br />place to gather insect larvae</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:51.00" id="p49" end="00:09:55.36">from under the rocks, using her<br />versatile hands and nimble fingers.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:04.08" id="p50" end="00:10:08.88">In winter, this troop spends most<br />of its time searching for food.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:15.12" id="p51" end="00:10:19.32">The same underground forces that<br />prevent this river from freezing</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:19.32" id="p52" end="00:10:22.12">bring great comfort to others.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:28.12" id="p53" end="00:10:31.88">The Japanese Alps were<br />built by volcanoes.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:31.88" id="p54" end="00:10:35.76">Many of them are still active.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:35.76" id="p55" end="00:10:42.72">And in a region called Hell's<br />Valley, some snow monkeys have<br />found the perfect winter resort.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:49.60" id="p56" end="00:10:52.60">A thermal spa,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:52.60" id="p57" end="00:10:56.28">where the water temperature<br />is a blissful 41 degrees centigrade.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:19.00" id="p58" end="00:11:23.32">Everyone wants in,<br />but primates being primates,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:23.32" id="p59" end="00:11:26.44">there are pool-side politics.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:36.84" id="p60" end="00:11:39.52">This is an exclusive members-only<br />club.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:39.52" id="p61" end="00:11:42.16">INFANT SCREECHES</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:42.16" id="p62" end="00:11:46.60">Only the highest-ranking females<br />and infants are allowed in.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:50.08" id="p63" end="00:11:56.04">Everyone obeys this male, who guards<br />the pool and vets the entrants.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:06.96" id="p64" end="00:12:13.00">These youngsters,<br />born of the right bloodline,<br />don't know how privileged they are.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:19.88" id="p65" end="00:12:24.00">Lower ranking individuals<br />are literally left out in the cold.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:31.68" id="p66" end="00:12:35.08">Japanese macaque society<br />is very divided.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:37.12" id="p67" end="00:12:40.28">There are those that have.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:40.28" id="p68" end="00:12:43.16">And those that have not.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:51.92" id="p69" end="00:12:59.32">And that is a harsh division,<br />because the sixty degrees that<br />separate the steaming water</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:59.32" id="p70" end="00:13:01.76">from the freezing surroundings</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:01.76" id="p71" end="00:13:05.68">can make the difference<br />between life and death.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:14.96" id="p72" end="00:13:19.04">But by far the majority<br />of primate species</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:19.04" id="p73" end="00:13:22.12">live in warm tropical forests.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:28.96" id="p74" end="00:13:32.96">Among them are the largest of all.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:38.92" id="p75" end="00:13:44.00">Gorillas live in stable family<br />groups with just a single leader,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:46.12" id="p76" end="00:13:48.44">a silverback male.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:57.92" id="p77" end="00:14:02.88">This one, here in the Congo basin,<br />is the guardian of his family</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:02.88" id="p78" end="00:14:06.08">which includes five females<br />and their infants.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:15.00" id="p79" end="00:14:19.32">He has the responsibility<br />of protecting them from the dangers</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:19.32" id="p80" end="00:14:22.48">that abound on the forest floor<br />where they feed.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:30.64" id="p81" end="00:14:37.44">To sustain his huge size, he must<br />consume up to thirty kilos a day.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:39.60" id="p82" end="00:14:46.84">It's mostly plant food,<br />but western gorillas also enjoy<br />a sprinkling of termites.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:51.72" id="p83" end="00:14:57.60">The youngsters need to eat<br />far less than their father,<br />so they've got time on their hands.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:03.64" id="p84" end="00:15:08.16">They like to play for the<br />same reasons we do...for fun.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:08.16" id="p85" end="00:15:11.12">And it helps build<br />long-lasting relationships.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:13.00" id="p86" end="00:15:16.60">Their protector<br />keeps a watchful eye on them.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:26.04" id="p87" end="00:15:28.40">But then...</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:30.32" id="p88" end="00:15:33.28">..it's time for his siesta.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:42.84" id="p89" end="00:15:45.60">DISTANT GRUNTING</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:48.56" id="p90" end="00:15:51.24">Something shatters the peace.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:58.56" id="p91" end="00:16:01.56">This silverback's<br />territory is one of the best.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:01.56" id="p92" end="00:16:05.08">But it has borders with at<br />least eight other gorilla groups.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:15.44" id="p93" end="00:16:17.84">DISTANT GRUNTING AND CHEST BEATING</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:19.32" id="p94" end="00:16:25.28">The sound of chest-beating<br />travels more than a mile<br />through the tangled under-storey.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:35.24" id="p95" end="00:16:38.16">It's a territorial drum-beat.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:41.92" id="p96" end="00:16:45.36">Everyone must know<br />who is boss around here.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:59.52" id="p97" end="00:17:04.04">Other smaller primates<br />are rather more secretive.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:17:05.72" id="p98" end="00:17:10.72">One of the most unusual<br />is found in Sulawesi, Indonesia.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:17:15.56" id="p99" end="00:17:21.32">It lives among the aerial roots<br />of this strangler fig.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:17:28.84" id="p100" end="00:17:33.88">Its ancestors were daytime hunters,<br />but they found that there was less</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:17:33.88" id="p101" end="00:17:37.60">competition if they looked for food<br />in the twilight.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:17:46.96" id="p102" end="00:17:50.44">Now they only stir after dark.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:17:59.04" id="p103" end="00:18:02.52">Nonetheless there's a lot of insect<br />food around.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:18:19.96" id="p104" end="00:18:22.16">The spectral tarsier.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:18:29.48" id="p105" end="00:18:32.96">Tarsiers are the only totally<br />carnivorous primates on Earth.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:18:37.28" id="p106" end="00:18:40.92">They've hardly changed<br />in 45 million years.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:18:43.52" id="p107" end="00:18:47.04">Their huge eyes can see<br />in even the faintest light.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:18:52.08" id="p108" end="00:18:58.00">These eye-balls are so wide<br />they can't swivel in their sockets -</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:18:58.00" id="p109" end="00:19:01.48">tarsiers have to rotate their heads.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:19:03.28" id="p110" end="00:19:07.76">Their mobile ears<br />can detect the faintest sounds.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:19:10.44" id="p111" end="00:19:14.92">And their powerful legs enable them<br />to jump 40 times their own length.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:19:22.52" id="p112" end="00:19:25.28">The family group fans out to hunt.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:19:30.40" id="p113" end="00:19:32.84">Prey is not hard to find.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:19:59.28" id="p114" end="00:20:02.48">But the tarsiers must be watchful.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:20:02.48" id="p115" end="00:20:09.04">For a primate just five inches tall,<br />life in the forest is full of<br />danger.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:12.64" id="p116" end="00:20:16.04"><span tts:color="yellow">The male sounds the alarm.<br /></span>CHIRPING</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:20:24.92" id="p117" end="00:20:27.72">And everyone retreats.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:52.64" id="p118" end="00:20:54.76">SHRILL CHIRPING CALLS</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:20:54.76" id="p119" end="00:21:00.88">Back in their family tree,<br />the senior male and female<br />send out piercing calls.</p>

      <p begin="00:49:44.16" id="p276" end="00:49:46.44">The chimps have disappeared off<br />down there,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:46.44" id="p277" end="00:49:50.80">they're gonna cross over into another<br />area of forest and hopefully<br />start using some tools.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:50.80" id="p278" end="00:49:54.60">Go and use tools,<br />that's what we're here for.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:49:56.40" id="p279" end="00:49:59.96">Chimpanzees have to accept you.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:49:59.96" id="p280" end="00:50:04.48">If they don't want to be filmed,<br />they'll simply disappear.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:50:07.64" id="p281" end="00:50:13.12">Justine needed the expert guidance<br />of Tatyana Humle, a primatologist</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:50:13.12" id="p282" end="00:50:16.72">who's spent more than ten<br />years studying these individuals.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:50:16.72" id="p283" end="00:50:23.60">So when we see them always<br />keep calm and don't stare<br />straight into the eyes.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:23.60" id="p284" end="00:50:26.80">Have you ever had problems with them<br />coming right up being aggressive?</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:50:26.80" id="p285" end="00:50:30.20">No, never, never.<br />I mean it's pretty rare, so...</p>
      <p begin="00:50:30.20" id="p286" end="00:50:34.28">I don't know what to expect cos<br />I've never seen them in the wild<br />before so it's a first for me.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:50:34.28" id="p287" end="00:50:40.68">So just always stay, stay calm<br />and if one of them walks by really<br />close, just ignore them.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:50:40.68" id="p288" end="00:50:44.12">One particular young male<br />might throw sticks,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:50:44.12" id="p289" end="00:50:46.88">ignore him as well,<br />it's like he's like a kid</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:50:46.88" id="p290" end="00:50:50.76">and he just wants attention<br />so he'll just keep doing it.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:50.76" id="p291" end="00:50:57.40">We've got to put these<br />face masks on in case we<br />pass on any infectious diseases.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:57.40" id="p292" end="00:51:01.44">Quite a few chimps have died in the<br />past from respiratory diseases</p>
      <p begin="00:51:01.44" id="p293" end="00:51:04.20">in other study sites,<br />so it's very important.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:51:15.08" id="p294" end="00:51:19.64">Justine was finding her way<br />with the chimps.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:51:19.64" id="p295" end="00:51:22.36">But it would take time.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:51:26.76" id="p296" end="00:51:29.80">It's never easy anticipating<br />their behaviour.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:31.96" id="p297" end="00:51:34.28">I'm trying to get ready really<br />quickly because we're expecting</p>
      <p begin="00:51:34.28" id="p298" end="00:51:37.16">some chimps to come down<br />the path straight ahead of me.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:39.36" id="p299" end="00:51:41.64">It'd be lovely if<br />they'd merge out into this clearing,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:41.64" id="p300" end="00:51:44.36">cos it's really difficult<br />to see through all this foliage.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:51:46.76" id="p301" end="00:51:50.24">Tatyana and her team<br />were invaluable,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:51:50.24" id="p302" end="00:51:54.68">they introduced Justine<br />to the chimps'<br />different habits and characters.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:52:08.20" id="p303" end="00:52:15.80">Soon the natural inquisitiveness<br />of the chimps overcame any worries<br />they might have had of Justine.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:52:20.36" id="p304" end="00:52:25.80">In fact, they seemed fascinated<br />by her, and the tools of her trade.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:52:31.20" id="p305" end="00:52:37.08">But it was their use of tools<br />that Justine was here to film.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:52:39.20" id="p306" end="00:52:42.28">And this was her first good<br />opportunity.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:46.88" id="p307" end="00:52:50.92">As I filmed them fishing for ants<br />I was amazed by their dexterity.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:52.44" id="p308" end="00:52:57.76">But holding focus in such low light<br />really tested my own<br />coordination to the limit.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:11.68" id="p309" end="00:53:13.80">Now she's moving away.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:53:13.80" id="p310" end="00:53:15.88">She's moving.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:15.88" id="p311" end="00:53:20.28">It's been all go today,<br />it's not over yet,</p>
      <p begin="00:53:20.28" id="p312" end="00:53:22.52">if we can get out of here<br />into an open,</p>
      <p begin="00:53:22.52" id="p313" end="00:53:26.64">more open area we'll actually have<br />enough light to film by</p>
      <p begin="00:53:26.64" id="p314" end="00:53:29.72">cos the sun's still up,<br />but I don't know.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:31.08" id="p315" end="00:53:36.52">Although Justine's<br />main goal was to film tool use,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:36.52" id="p316" end="00:53:40.20">there was another piece of behaviour<br />she really wanted to capture.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:47.20" id="p317" end="00:53:54.56">Buttress root drumming had never<br />been filmed here before but she<br />was always just a bit too late.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:54.56" id="p318" end="00:53:57.64">Back at yet another buttress in<br />the hope that we might</p>
      <p begin="00:53:57.64" id="p319" end="00:54:01.04">get some sort of buttress drumming,<br />but it's started raining</p>
      <p begin="00:54:01.04" id="p320" end="00:54:03.40">which is an absolute pain.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:06.20" id="p321" end="00:54:09.24">It's a waiting game.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:12.44" id="p322" end="00:54:17.08">Just staking out a couple of really<br />big trees that have got very large<br />buttress roots</p>
      <p begin="00:54:17.08" id="p323" end="00:54:20.68">in the hope that a male will come<br />down and drum on them.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:20.68" id="p324" end="00:54:25.00">The drumming always happens<br />somewhere else, and apparently,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:25.00" id="p325" end="00:54:28.08">it's usually the males that sort<br />of sneak off to go and do it,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:28.08" id="p326" end="00:54:31.12">it feels like a<br />bit of a long shot at the moment.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:31.12" id="p327" end="00:54:34.04">I've have to have some patience.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:36.12" id="p328" end="00:54:40.84">The thing about chimps<br />is that, like most primates,<br />you can't always predict</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:40.84" id="p329" end="00:54:45.52">what they're going to do, when<br />they're going to do it, or where.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:48.40" id="p330" end="00:54:52.28">You've just got to keep with them.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:54.88" id="p331" end="00:55:00.16">A different type of sound brought<br />Justine back to her main mission.</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:18.28" id="p334" end="00:55:22.60">This was the key sequence<br />Justine was here to film.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:31.16" id="p335" end="00:55:35.92">Filming the chimps using tools<br />made me realise just<br />how close to them we are.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:44.84" id="p336" end="00:55:48.28">I felt so similar to them.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:57.24" id="p337" end="00:56:00.36">By the end of our filming trip<br />I was able to recognise</p>
      <p begin="00:56:00.36" id="p338" end="00:56:05.76">most of the individuals in the group<br />and had begun to understand<br />their different personalities.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:34.20" id="p339" end="00:56:36.92">For me, the most poignant moment<br />of all</p>
      <p begin="00:56:36.92" id="p340" end="00:56:41.48">was when the male the scientist<br />called Clay lent a female his tools.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:50.80" id="p341" end="00:56:53.32">I know that primates<br />are very social animals</p>
      <p begin="00:56:53.32" id="p342" end="00:56:56.64">but seeing this act of generosity<br />was something that I'll never forget.</p>
