Intelligence, curiosity and complex societies have enabled [[primate]]s to exploit many different habitats. In [[Ethiopia]], male [[Hamadryas baboon]]s restore discipline after a skirmish with a rival troop. In [[Japanese macaque]] society, only those members from the correct bloodlines are permitted to use [[thermal spring]]s in winter; others are left out in the cold. Examples of primate communication include a silverback [[Western lowland gorilla|gorilla]] advertising his territory though vocalisations and chest-beating, and the piercing calls of [[spectral tarsier]]s which help keep their group together. In [[Thailand]]'s rainforests, [[lar gibbon]]s use song to reinforce sexual and family bonds. By contrast, [[ring-tailed lemur]]s in [[Madagascar]] broadcast sexual signals using scent glands. A young [[orangutan]]'s upbringing equips it with all the skills it needs to survive in the forest, including finding food, moving through the canopy and building a shelter. On [[South Africa]]'s [[Cape Peninsula]], [[chacma baboon]]s forage kelp beds exposed by the lowest tides for nutritious [[Egg case (skates, rays and sharks)|shark egg]]s and [[mussel]]s. [[White-headed Capuchin|White-faced capuchin]]s collect [[clam]]s in [[Costa Rica]]'s coastal [[mangrove]]s, but lack the powerful jaws to pierce the shells. Their solution is to beat the shellfish against trees or rocks, which eventually exhausts the muscle that holds the shell closed. ''Life on Location'' follows camerawoman Justine Evans to [[Guinea]] to film [[tool use]] in [[chimpanzee]]s. Dextrous hand movements enable them to dip for [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s using plant stems. They have also learned to crack nuts using precise and efficient blows with a stone. One male chimp is filmed sharing his stone with a female.<ref name=bbc-episode-10>{{cite episode |title=Primates |series=Life |credits=Produced by Patrick Morris |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-12-14|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00pcm3h}}</ref>
