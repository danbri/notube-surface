      <p begin="00:00:23.28" id="p0" end="00:00:27.16">The ocean.<br />The largest habitat on Earth,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.16" id="p1" end="00:00:32.04">and an inhospitable place<br />for those of us who live on land.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.40" id="p2" end="00:00:40.00">Yet, for a billion years,<br />this was the only place on the planet</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.00" id="p3" end="00:00:41.84">where life existed.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.44" id="p4" end="00:00:54.48">Today, descendants of those early<br />life forms continue to thrive.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.00" id="p5" end="00:01:04.16">They share the sea with fish,<br />but outnumber them by ten to one.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.48" id="p6" end="00:01:08.40">They have no backbones,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.40" id="p7" end="00:01:11.60">and have evolved<br />into countless different forms.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.76" id="p8" end="00:01:20.52">Some are huge, large-brained<br />and intelligent.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:26.88" id="p9" end="00:01:29.36">Others are minuscule,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.36" id="p10" end="00:01:33.32">yet build the largest natural<br />structures on the planet.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.48" id="p11" end="00:01:49.84">They are marine invertebrates,<br />the creatures of the deep.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.48" id="p12" end="00:02:07.36">They have colonised every corner<br />of the ocean,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:07.36" id="p13" end="00:02:10.72">and have<br />a mind-boggling range of solutions</p>
      <p begin="00:02:10.72" id="p14" end="00:02:12.96">to the problem of staying alive.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:32.40" id="p15" end="00:02:35.08">The ocean is by no means uniform.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:35.08" id="p16" end="00:02:39.52">Differences in depth, temperature,<br />sunlight and currents</p>
      <p begin="00:02:39.52" id="p17" end="00:02:41.76">pose particular challenges.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:43.04" id="p18" end="00:02:48.08">One and a half miles down,<br />these hydrothermal vents</p>
      <p begin="00:02:48.08" id="p19" end="00:02:52.88">spew out super-heated water<br />at 450 degrees Centigrade</p>
      <p begin="00:02:52.88" id="p20" end="00:02:55.92">from cracks in the Earth's crust.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:58.08" id="p21" end="00:03:01.00">Despite the enormous pressure,<br />the total darkness,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.00" id="p22" end="00:03:03.12">and the scaldingly-high temperatures,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.12" id="p23" end="00:03:08.76">the ancestors of all life may have<br />evolved in a place just like this.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:11.72" id="p24" end="00:03:14.40">Pompeii worms.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:14.40" id="p25" end="00:03:18.84">So named for their ability<br />to survive volcanic heat.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:23.04" id="p26" end="00:03:28.12">They share the vents with crabs<br />and two-metre-long tube worms.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:29.44" id="p27" end="00:03:34.48">They can only survive here because<br />they are able to feed on bacteria</p>
      <p begin="00:03:34.48" id="p28" end="00:03:37.20">that thrive around the vents.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.08" id="p29" end="00:03:47.12">These colonies are extremely rare.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:49.96" id="p30" end="00:03:52.80">Not surprisingly, most life thrives</p>
      <p begin="00:03:52.80" id="p31" end="00:03:57.72">nearer the surface,<br />where feeding is considerably easier.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:04.92" id="p32" end="00:04:09.60">These are krill,<br />tiny shrimp-like crustaceans.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:10.88" id="p33" end="00:04:16.08">Swarms can reach astounding numbers -<br />60,000 per cubic metre.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:19.88" id="p34" end="00:04:24.32">During the night they rise towards<br />the surface to feed on plankton.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:27.72" id="p35" end="00:04:30.44">Here, in the Sea of Cortez,<br />off Mexico,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:30.44" id="p36" end="00:04:33.64">the swarms attract<br />hunters of all kinds,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:33.64" id="p37" end="00:04:37.20">from humpback whales<br />to shoals of predatory fish.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:45.88" id="p38" end="00:04:48.20">Yet another hunter arrives.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:48.20" id="p39" end="00:04:50.24">It's one from the deep.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:53.72" id="p40" end="00:04:55.84">A Humboldt squid.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:58.92" id="p41" end="00:05:04.12">Two metres long, they have<br />a local reputation as man-eaters.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:07.52" id="p42" end="00:05:10.28">Alone, they are formidable enough...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:11.24" id="p43" end="00:05:12.96">..but this is a pack...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:13.92" id="p44" end="00:05:15.60">..of hundreds.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:20.16" id="p45" end="00:05:24.28">They are highly intelligent hunters.<br />Their eyesight is exceptional.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:24.28" id="p46" end="00:05:28.88">They have powerful tentacles,<br />suckers ringed with 70,000 hooks</p>
      <p begin="00:05:28.88" id="p47" end="00:05:31.76">and a razor-sharp beak<br />for tearing through flesh.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:38.48" id="p48" end="00:05:41.84">Now the fish<br />find that they are under attack</p>
      <p begin="00:05:41.84" id="p49" end="00:05:44.76">and so group together for safety.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:49.60" id="p50" end="00:05:52.72">But the Humboldt squid<br />work as a team,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:52.72" id="p51" end="00:05:54.56">herding the fish against the rocks.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:13.40" id="p52" end="00:06:18.80">It's thought that the squid<br />flash red and white<br />not only to confuse their prey,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:18.80" id="p53" end="00:06:23.24">but also to signal to each other<br />when they are about to attack.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:04.40" id="p54" end="00:07:08.40">Humboldt squid numbers<br />are growing rapidly.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:09.96" id="p55" end="00:07:12.80">But they remain mysterious.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:13.80" id="p56" end="00:07:18.44">As fast as they arrived, they<br />disappear back into the deep.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:29.32" id="p57" end="00:07:36.40">800 miles from the South Pole, in the<br />shadow of a smouldering Mount Erebus.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:43.72" id="p58" end="00:07:47.48">Winter temperatures<br />are a punishing minus 40.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:51.40" id="p59" end="00:07:57.24">This, perhaps, is the last place<br />you might expect to find marine life.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:16.44" id="p60" end="00:08:20.16">Now it's the beginning<br />of the polar spring,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:20.16" id="p61" end="00:08:22.16">and for the first time in months,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:22.16" id="p62" end="00:08:25.76">light reaches the sea<br />beneath the ice.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:34.56" id="p63" end="00:08:38.84">It's extremely cold and completely<br />dark for much of the year,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:38.84" id="p64" end="00:08:42.44">so conditions are not unlike<br />those of the deep ocean.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:48.28" id="p65" end="00:08:52.60">Yet, in McMurdo Sound,<br />life flourishes.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:10.56" id="p66" end="00:09:14.52">The creatures here<br />grow extremely slowly.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:14.52" id="p67" end="00:09:19.32">But that does mean they can reach<br />a great age and great size,</p>
      <p begin="00:09:19.32" id="p68" end="00:09:23.56">and they occur in<br />surprisingly large numbers.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:37.00" id="p69" end="00:09:40.76">Three-metre-long, carnivorous<br />nemertean worms.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:40.76" id="p70" end="00:09:42.80">Red sea stars</p>
      <p begin="00:09:42.80" id="p71" end="00:09:46.68">and urchins carpet the sea floor.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:53.84" id="p72" end="00:09:57.64">This monster-worm<br />will eat almost anything</p>
      <p begin="00:09:57.64" id="p73" end="00:10:01.20">and is constantly scanning<br />the sea floor for food.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:13.64" id="p74" end="00:10:18.68">Animals are swarming here<br />in such numbers because of this...</p>
      <p begin="00:10:19.64" id="p75" end="00:10:21.72">..a dead seal pup.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:25.56" id="p76" end="00:10:27.72">Such a great quantity of food</p>
      <p begin="00:10:27.72" id="p77" end="00:10:30.24">may only arrive once in ten years.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:30.24" id="p78" end="00:10:33.76">But a seal's body<br />won't be easy to eat.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:40.56" id="p79" end="00:10:43.32">Nemerteans have a snout<br />like a harpoon,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:43.32" id="p80" end="00:10:46.68">that enables them to puncture<br />the skin of the corpse.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:56.36" id="p81" end="00:10:59.52">It's harder work for the sea stars.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:59.52" id="p82" end="00:11:03.24">They feed by pushing out their<br />stomachs through their mouths.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:06.88" id="p83" end="00:11:11.52">As this sea star presses its stomach<br />against the seal's skin,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:11.52" id="p84" end="00:11:16.76">it secretes digestive juices that<br />dissolve the seal's tissue.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:16.76" id="p85" end="00:11:18.92">But that takes time.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:25.92" id="p86" end="00:11:29.36">These scavengers will feed here<br />throughout the summer,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:29.36" id="p87" end="00:11:34.88">until all that remains of the seal<br />will be a skeleton, stripped bare.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:41.88" id="p88" end="00:11:46.48">The shallows are only a tiny part<br />of the marine world.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:46.48" id="p89" end="00:11:50.56">90% of it is open water.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:53.36" id="p90" end="00:11:57.36">Its currents carry life<br />for thousands of miles.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:01.40" id="p91" end="00:12:06.20">The masters of this nomadic existence<br />are jellyfish.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:08.48" id="p92" end="00:12:12.76">A life spent drifting in the empty<br />ocean could be a lonely one...</p>
      <p begin="00:12:12.84" id="p93" end="00:12:15.08">but not for this jellyfish.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:18.08" id="p94" end="00:12:19.88">Aurelia.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:22.00" id="p95" end="00:12:25.16">Swarms like this are not accidental.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:25.16" id="p96" end="00:12:27.40">These individuals<br />all hatched together</p>
      <p begin="00:12:27.40" id="p97" end="00:12:31.00">when the temperature<br />and currents were just right.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:34.72" id="p98" end="00:12:37.88">Their timing has ensured<br />that they can make the most</p>
      <p begin="00:12:37.88" id="p99" end="00:12:41.80">of feeding on<br />a late-summer plankton bloom.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:04.40" id="p100" end="00:13:08.88">Jellyfish have no brain and no blood.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:08.88" id="p101" end="00:13:15.08">But they do have eyespots that enable<br />them to tell the difference<br />between light and dark.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:15.08" id="p102" end="00:13:17.56">And they can move<br />independently of the current</p>
      <p begin="00:13:17.56" id="p103" end="00:13:20.64">by a simple form of jet propulsion.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:29.44" id="p104" end="00:13:33.72">All jellyfish have stinging tentacles<br />with which to catch their food.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:33.72" id="p105" end="00:13:37.60">As they pulse their bodies,<br />the tentacles trap plankton,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:37.60" id="p106" end="00:13:41.28">which is then passed towards<br />their mouth in the centre.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:02.56" id="p107" end="00:14:06.60">A swarm of 100,000 stinging jellyfish</p>
      <p begin="00:14:06.60" id="p108" end="00:14:10.00">might seem a daunting prospect<br />for a predator...</p>
      <p begin="00:14:12.48" id="p109" end="00:14:15.24">..but not for this one.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:15.24" id="p110" end="00:14:18.52">A huge fried egg jellyfish.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:19.72" id="p111" end="00:14:22.00">It is a killer.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:25.60" id="p112" end="00:14:30.24">Its weapons are harpoon-like cells<br />that cover its tentacles.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:32.80" id="p113" end="00:14:37.16">When they come into contact<br />with a victim, they spear it.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:51.36" id="p114" end="00:14:55.20">The fried egg then hauls in its prey.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:02.48" id="p115" end="00:15:07.64">A few lucky Aurelia do manage<br />to pull themselves free.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:13.12" id="p116" end="00:15:17.20">But for the majority,<br />there is only one outcome...</p>
      <p begin="00:15:18.16" id="p117" end="00:15:20.00">Death.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:34.00" id="p118" end="00:15:37.68">Jellyfish, like a great many<br />marine invertebrates,</p>
      <p begin="00:15:37.68" id="p119" end="00:15:40.52">have soft, vulnerable bodies.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:44.52" id="p120" end="00:15:48.40">They are protected by stinging cells.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:53.60" id="p121" end="00:15:56.88">But there are other kinds of defence.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:00.96" id="p122" end="00:16:02.92">Armour plating.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:18.04" id="p123" end="00:16:20.68">These are spider crabs.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:20.68" id="p124" end="00:16:24.60">They spend most of their lives<br />in deep water.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:24.60" id="p125" end="00:16:28.44">But once a year,<br />off the coast of Southern Australia,</p>
      <p begin="00:16:28.44" id="p126" end="00:16:34.28">a quarter of a million crabs<br />set off on a long journey<br />to the shallows.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:41.04" id="p127" end="00:16:44.44">They are here<br />because they all share a problem.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:44.44" id="p128" end="00:16:49.64">Each crab has been wearing the same<br />suit of armour for a year now.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:53.72" id="p129" end="00:16:57.68">And it's getting uncomfortably tight.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:01.88" id="p130" end="00:17:08.60">So each crab eventually has to shed<br />its shell and produce a bigger one.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:08.60" id="p131" end="00:17:14.76">Replacing an old shell is<br />understandably a tricky process.</p>

      <p begin="00:17:25.68" id="p133" end="00:17:31.12">It then flexes its body to force its<br />shell to split along the back...</p>

      <p begin="00:18:05.36" id="p137" end="00:18:09.68">Coming together in such numbers<br />does however have a drawback.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:12.88" id="p138" end="00:18:15.44">It attracts predators.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:19.16" id="p139" end="00:18:21.04">A stingray.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:35.52" id="p140" end="00:18:38.40">Despite there being<br />so many potential prey,</p>
      <p begin="00:18:38.40" id="p141" end="00:18:41.28">the stingray seems to ignore them.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:41.28" id="p142" end="00:18:43.48">Perhaps there's safety in numbers...</p>
      <p begin="00:18:46.20" id="p143" end="00:18:48.08">..although not all the crabs</p>
      <p begin="00:18:48.08" id="p144" end="00:18:50.04">are prepared to rely on it.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:57.68" id="p145" end="00:19:00.76">Alarm spreads amongst the crabs.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:09.84" id="p146" end="00:19:14.96">But in fact, most of them are safe.<br />This ray is being very choosy.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:14.96" id="p147" end="00:19:17.80">It's only interested<br />in the softest shelled,</p>
      <p begin="00:19:17.80" id="p148" end="00:19:20.08">most recently moulted crabs.</p>
      <p begin="00:19:32.64" id="p149" end="00:19:37.32">Once a target is singled out,<br />there is no escape.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:06.96" id="p150" end="00:20:09.16">When their new armour has hardened,</p>
      <p begin="00:20:09.16" id="p151" end="00:20:13.00">the crabs return to<br />the comparative safety of the deep,</p>

      <p begin="00:20:20.72" id="p153" end="00:20:28.80">Like spider crabs, the behaviour of<br />most marine creatures is controlled<br />by a very simple nervous system.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:28.80" id="p154" end="00:20:31.28">But there are exceptions.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:36.48" id="p155" end="00:20:42.20">This cuttlefish is one of<br />the cleverest animals in the ocean.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:42.20" id="p156" end="00:20:44.64">She has a very large brain.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:44.64" id="p157" end="00:20:50.12">In fact, it's larger for her size<br />than that of most fish or reptiles.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:52.24" id="p158" end="00:20:56.64">Her life is both complex<br />and full of intrigue.</p>
      <p begin="00:20:58.40" id="p159" end="00:21:01.96">Giant Australian cuttlefish<br />usually live alone,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:01.96" id="p160" end="00:21:06.04">but once in their short lives<br />they must come together to mate.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:16.80" id="p161" end="00:21:20.68">As she approaches<br />the traditional mating grounds,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:20.68" id="p162" end="00:21:25.04">one of the largest males<br />starts to show interest in her.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:32.16" id="p163" end="00:21:36.40">She moves him away from his rivals<br />to a quieter spot -</p>
      <p begin="00:21:36.40" id="p164" end="00:21:40.84">a place where she will be able<br />to lay her eggs in safety.</p>
      <p begin="00:21:51.00" id="p165" end="00:21:56.20">The male takes the female in his arms<br />and turns her to face him,</p>
      <p begin="00:21:56.20" id="p166" end="00:22:00.08">before using one of his arms<br />to pass sacks of sperm</p>
      <p begin="00:22:00.08" id="p167" end="00:22:02.36">to an opening near her mouth.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:38.68" id="p168" end="00:22:41.64">Once mated, he hovers over her,</p>
      <p begin="00:22:41.64" id="p169" end="00:22:45.00">standing guard<br />until she's laid her eggs.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:51.32" id="p170" end="00:22:53.48">But he's got a problem.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:53.48" id="p171" end="00:22:56.52">Males outnumber females four to one.</p>
      <p begin="00:22:56.52" id="p172" end="00:23:01.08">So keeping her to himself<br />is a constant battle.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:23.84" id="p173" end="00:23:28.40">This larger rival<br />is more difficult to intimidate.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:30.16" id="p174" end="00:23:34.00">Cuttlefish can make very dramatic<br />changes to their skin pattern</p>
      <p begin="00:23:34.00" id="p175" end="00:23:36.44">in order to signal their moods.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:41.76" id="p176" end="00:23:46.20">Flushes of bright colour and stripes<br />that pulse along his side,</p>
      <p begin="00:23:46.20" id="p177" end="00:23:48.68">tell the rival to keep off.</p>
      <p begin="00:23:59.24" id="p178" end="00:24:04.08">Most rivals back down at this stage,<br />but not this one.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:05.76" id="p179" end="00:24:10.20">Although the male's flashing signals<br />get more and more emphatic,</p>
      <p begin="00:24:10.20" id="p180" end="00:24:14.60">in the end,<br />he has no choice but to fight.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:50.32" id="p181" end="00:24:55.32">Victory! And the male can return<br />to guard his female.</p>
      <p begin="00:24:58.52" id="p182" end="00:25:03.36">Cuttlefish are great communicators,<br />but there is a flip side -</p>
      <p begin="00:25:03.36" id="p183" end="00:25:06.36">they can also<br />be masters of deception.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:15.88" id="p184" end="00:25:21.40">This male is too small to fight<br />for a mate, but he has another plan -</p>
      <p begin="00:25:21.40" id="p185" end="00:25:23.44">and it's sneaky.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:24.80" id="p186" end="00:25:27.76">He approaches the couple cautiously,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:27.76" id="p187" end="00:25:30.32">holding his tentacles<br />tucked up at the front,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:30.32" id="p188" end="00:25:33.24">mimicking a female<br />that wants to mate.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:34.24" id="p189" end="00:25:35.88">To complete his disguise,</p>
      <p begin="00:25:35.88" id="p190" end="00:25:40.44">he changes colour to appear<br />even more like a female.</p>
      <p begin="00:25:41.92" id="p191" end="00:25:46.64">The guarding male seems convinced,<br />maybe he thinks his luck is in -</p>
      <p begin="00:25:46.64" id="p192" end="00:25:50.40">another female<br />to add to his conquests.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:07.16" id="p193" end="00:26:09.04">The sly, cross-dressing male</p>
      <p begin="00:26:09.04" id="p194" end="00:26:13.76">edges closer and closer<br />to the female, holding his nerve.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:13.76" id="p195" end="00:26:19.48">As long as he avoids being grabbed in<br />a mating embrace, the sneak is safe.</p>
      <p begin="00:26:28.92" id="p196" end="00:26:33.52">At what point the female guesses<br />his true identity is unclear,</p>
      <p begin="00:26:33.52" id="p197" end="00:26:37.60">but she isn't choosy,<br />and surreptitiously mates with him</p>
      <p begin="00:26:37.60" id="p198" end="00:26:40.28">right under<br />the larger male's tentacles.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:05.56" id="p199" end="00:27:08.56">It's time for the female<br />to lay her eggs.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:08.56" id="p200" end="00:27:14.84">Using the sperm from both males,<br />she fertilises her eggs one by one</p>
      <p begin="00:27:14.84" id="p201" end="00:27:18.56">and glues them to a rock<br />in a hidden crevice.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:21.12" id="p202" end="00:27:24.36">With luck,<br />she will now have a mix of offspring.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:24.36" id="p203" end="00:27:29.20">Some may become masterful males,<br />and others, little sneaks.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:29.20" id="p204" end="00:27:32.32">She'll have all the bases covered.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:37.48" id="p205" end="00:27:40.56">The coastal waters<br />of British Columbia.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:45.52" id="p206" end="00:27:51.08">Home to this four-metre-long<br />Pacific Giant Octopus.</p>
      <p begin="00:27:57.24" id="p207" end="00:28:03.84">She is a formidable predator,<br />but at the moment<br />hunting isn't on her mind.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:10.84" id="p208" end="00:28:14.72">She has just mated<br />for the first time.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:15.68" id="p209" end="00:28:19.16">And now she's searching<br />for a safe refuge.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:32.92" id="p210" end="00:28:35.28">She makes her choice carefully.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:35.28" id="p211" end="00:28:39.92">This is going to be her home<br />for many months to come.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:52.60" id="p212" end="00:28:55.36">It's her nursery den.</p>
      <p begin="00:28:58.40" id="p213" end="00:29:01.44">100,000 eggs hang from its ceiling,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:01.44" id="p214" end="00:29:04.28">and she's guarding them<br />with her life.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:08.16" id="p215" end="00:29:12.92">Without her to protect them,<br />they would be eaten by predators,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:12.92" id="p216" end="00:29:14.92">or become diseased.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:16.40" id="p217" end="00:29:18.84">She caresses them with her tentacles,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:18.84" id="p218" end="00:29:24.00">ensuring that algae don't grow on<br />them, and that fish don't eat them.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:25.64" id="p219" end="00:29:29.20">She constantly keeps<br />the water moving around them,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:29.20" id="p220" end="00:29:31.88">so they're well-supplied with oxygen.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:42.24" id="p221" end="00:29:45.44">She cares for them for six months,</p>
      <p begin="00:29:45.44" id="p222" end="00:29:49.44">and during all this time,<br />she doesn't eat a thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:29:57.60" id="p223" end="00:30:00.64">And now, as they are hatching,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:00.64" id="p224" end="00:30:02.92">she is dying.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:13.04" id="p225" end="00:30:16.64">One night,<br />as the baby octopus emerge,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:16.64" id="p226" end="00:30:22.16">she jets water over them for the last<br />time, helping them on their way.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:27.16" id="p227" end="00:30:29.68">This will be her final act.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:35.56" id="p228" end="00:30:39.16">This is the only time<br />she will reproduce,</p>
      <p begin="00:30:39.16" id="p229" end="00:30:46.96">and to give her young their best<br />chance, she sacrifices her life.</p>
      <p begin="00:30:55.12" id="p230" end="00:31:01.84">Out of the depths comes one<br />of the largest and most aggressive<br />starfish in the ocean.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:01.84" id="p231" end="00:31:03.52">Pycnopodia,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:03.52" id="p232" end="00:31:08.28">a giant sunstar the size<br />of a dustbin lid.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:14.32" id="p233" end="00:31:19.68">It's a hunter. Each arm is covered<br />by super-sensitive tube feet,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:19.68" id="p234" end="00:31:22.52">that can detect prey<br />by touch and smell.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:29.36" id="p235" end="00:31:33.04">But the sunstar is also partial<br />to carrion,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:33.04" id="p236" end="00:31:37.60">and it detects the carcass<br />of the giant octopus mother.</p>
      <p begin="00:31:45.80" id="p237" end="00:31:49.60">The miniature suckers on its feet<br />clamp on to the corpse,</p>
      <p begin="00:31:49.60" id="p238" end="00:31:52.08">and drag it out of the cave.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:02.20" id="p239" end="00:32:05.20">Other scavengers rush<br />to join the feast.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:20.56" id="p240" end="00:32:23.32">Although it's a fearsome predator,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:23.32" id="p241" end="00:32:26.04">Pycnopodia doesn't have<br />it all its own way.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:28.20" id="p242" end="00:32:31.48">These sea urchins aren't<br />speedy enough to escape,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:31.48" id="p243" end="00:32:34.32">but they do have<br />a formidable defence.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:34.32" id="p244" end="00:32:37.56">The sharp spines<br />are hard to get past,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:37.56" id="p245" end="00:32:42.68">and, what's more, the urchins<br />can move each spine independently,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:42.68" id="p246" end="00:32:45.40">pinching the starfish's probing arms.</p>
      <p begin="00:32:57.12" id="p247" end="00:32:59.20">Trapped by an army of urchins,</p>
      <p begin="00:32:59.20" id="p248" end="00:33:04.16">Pycnopodia is spotted<br />by an enormous king crab.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:11.00" id="p249" end="00:33:13.76">Pycnopodia has more than<br />met its match,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:13.76" id="p250" end="00:33:17.44">and within seconds,<br />the crab rips off one of its arms.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:27.60" id="p251" end="00:33:30.76">But that is just<br />a temporary inconvenience.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:30.76" id="p252" end="00:33:35.96">Starfish are able to quickly regrow<br />a lost limb.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:41.64" id="p253" end="00:33:45.12">The most impressive invertebrates<br />may seem to be the giants,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:45.12" id="p254" end="00:33:50.24">but in fact it's some of the smallest<br />that can make the biggest impact.</p>
      <p begin="00:33:53.04" id="p255" end="00:33:56.36">Every square inch of this island<br />has been created</p>
      <p begin="00:33:56.36" id="p256" end="00:33:59.24">by an ever-growing,<br />living superstructure,</p>
      <p begin="00:33:59.24" id="p257" end="00:34:00.92">a coral reef.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:02.52" id="p258" end="00:34:05.76">It's taken thousands of years<br />to reach this size,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:05.76" id="p259" end="00:34:10.20">and it all began with creatures<br />smaller than a pinhead.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:31.92" id="p260" end="00:34:34.84">A reef can't be built just anywhere,</p>
      <p begin="00:34:34.84" id="p261" end="00:34:37.56">it needs something<br />to give it a firm footing.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:42.24" id="p262" end="00:34:46.64">A wreck like this<br />provides an excellent foundation.</p>
      <p begin="00:34:59.80" id="p263" end="00:35:01.84">As soon as it settles on the sea bed,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:01.84" id="p264" end="00:35:05.60">the wreck comes under attack<br />from invaders -</p>
      <p begin="00:35:05.60" id="p265" end="00:35:08.44">plankton, carried here<br />by ocean currents.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:12.84" id="p266" end="00:35:17.12">These are the microscopic larvae<br />of barnacles, sponges,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:17.12" id="p267" end="00:35:20.24">and, most importantly, corals.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:29.36" id="p268" end="00:35:33.40">The larvae must attach themselves<br />to the wreck.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:33.40" id="p269" end="00:35:37.88">Once there, they can develop<br />into young corals called polyps.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:40.88" id="p270" end="00:35:43.60">But the polyps are very slow-growing,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:43.60" id="p271" end="00:35:47.60">and there is lots of competition<br />from other invaders.</p>
      <p begin="00:35:55.32" id="p272" end="00:35:57.36">Algae quickly cover the wreck,</p>
      <p begin="00:35:57.36" id="p273" end="00:36:00.16">and that's a problem<br />for the young coral.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:14.12" id="p274" end="00:36:16.80">Algae attract grazers.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:23.16" id="p275" end="00:36:29.04">The polyps are in danger<br />of being eaten before<br />they've even got a proper foothold.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:31.32" id="p276" end="00:36:33.00">If conditions are right,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:33.00" id="p277" end="00:36:36.44">the survivors can go on<br />to build a reef.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:39.80" id="p278" end="00:36:41.92">Position is critical.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:42.96" id="p279" end="00:36:47.56">Too deep, and not enough light will<br />reach the corals for them to grow.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:47.56" id="p280" end="00:36:53.28">Too shallow, and they risk<br />being exposed to the air at low tide.</p>
      <p begin="00:36:55.08" id="p281" end="00:36:57.08">For the reef to really flourish,</p>
      <p begin="00:36:57.08" id="p282" end="00:37:01.36">it also needs to be in the path<br />of currents carrying food.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:11.64" id="p283" end="00:37:14.04">Fast-forward<br />half a dozen years or so,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:14.04" id="p284" end="00:37:17.36">and the wreck will begin<br />to show the first signs</p>
      <p begin="00:37:17.36" id="p285" end="00:37:19.84">of corals visible to the naked eye.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:27.00" id="p286" end="00:37:30.72">A decade later,<br />and the wreck will be transformed.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:36.52" id="p287" end="00:37:42.04">Thousands of polyps will form coral<br />heads that encrust its surface.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:45.40" id="p288" end="00:37:50.04">This ship was sunk during<br />the Second World War,</p>
      <p begin="00:37:50.04" id="p289" end="00:37:54.84">and there has been enough time<br />for a substantial reef to develop.</p>
      <p begin="00:37:58.36" id="p290" end="00:38:00.08">After decades of growth,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:00.08" id="p291" end="00:38:05.32">different species of corals dominate<br />particular areas of the wreck.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:11.84" id="p292" end="00:38:17.00">The fastest-growing types<br />grow best on the edges and overhangs,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:17.00" id="p293" end="00:38:20.04">reaching far out into the water,<br />and up to the light.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:22.36" id="p294" end="00:38:25.56">They need only a small area<br />to establish themselves,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:25.56" id="p295" end="00:38:29.80">yet they can rapidly grow dozens<br />of plates, or branches,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:29.80" id="p296" end="00:38:33.12">crammed with polyps, to gather<br />as much light as possible.</p>
      <p begin="00:38:51.20" id="p297" end="00:38:56.08">Slower-growing, much more robust<br />corals like these brain corals,</p>
      <p begin="00:38:56.08" id="p298" end="00:38:59.32">are better suited to the heart<br />of the developing reef.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:01.92" id="p299" end="00:39:06.60">It's these that give the reef<br />their structure and permanence.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:10.04" id="p300" end="00:39:13.04">There could be nearly 500<br />different species here,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:13.04" id="p301" end="00:39:17.04">each striving to win a foothold<br />on the rusting hulk.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:20.40" id="p302" end="00:39:23.96">The pace of life for corals<br />may seem to be so slow,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:23.96" id="p303" end="00:39:28.32">that it's hard to imagine<br />that there is any conflict here.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:32.24" id="p304" end="00:39:36.76">But, as night falls,<br />the mood on the reef changes.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:39.96" id="p305" end="00:39:43.92">Corals are, in fact,<br />extremely aggressive,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:43.92" id="p306" end="00:39:47.16">and will fight to the death<br />to expand their territory.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:48.56" id="p307" end="00:39:50.84">There can be no honourable retreat,</p>
      <p begin="00:39:50.84" id="p308" end="00:39:55.20">a winner will, literally,<br />eat its enemy alive.</p>
      <p begin="00:39:57.56" id="p309" end="00:40:03.32">Along the battle front, the polyps of<br />both combatants extrude their guts,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:03.32" id="p310" end="00:40:06.80">long thread-like filaments,<br />over their opponents.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:08.64" id="p311" end="00:40:13.04">At the fringe, all that remains<br />of the destroyed polyps</p>
      <p begin="00:40:13.04" id="p312" end="00:40:14.84">are their skeletons.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:16.72" id="p313" end="00:40:20.88">The coral that can digest fastest,<br />wins.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:25.72" id="p314" end="00:40:30.64">Corals constantly grow over<br />the skeletons of their dead comrades,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:30.64" id="p315" end="00:40:32.84">building a bigger and bigger reef.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:35.16" id="p316" end="00:40:37.52">Then, just once a year,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:37.52" id="p317" end="00:40:41.84">a few days after the November<br />full moon, the corals take part</p>
      <p begin="00:40:41.84" id="p318" end="00:40:44.04">in a mass spawning event.</p>
      <p begin="00:40:50.68" id="p319" end="00:40:53.52">Millions of eggs and sperm are<br />released into the water,</p>
      <p begin="00:40:53.52" id="p320" end="00:40:59.20">and join, to develop into larvae that<br />drift in search of a place to settle.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:37.16" id="p321" end="00:41:42.44">Eventually, every inch of the wreck's<br />surface will be colonised.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:42.44" id="p322" end="00:41:46.64">The steel will rust away,<br />and the reef will be on its own.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:56.32" id="p323" end="00:42:01.00">Most reefs grow without the help<br />of a wreck to start them off.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:01.00" id="p324" end="00:42:05.84">But, given time, they can create<br />something as huge as this,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:05.84" id="p325" end="00:42:10.76">the Great Barrier Reef, the largest<br />living structure on Earth.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:26.92" id="p326" end="00:42:32.28">A coral reef rivals even a rainforest<br />for its diversity of life.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:32.28" id="p327" end="00:42:36.84">Yet corals like this are found<br />in waters where food is very scarce.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:40.60" id="p328" end="00:42:44.40">All the creatures here have had<br />to adopt a different</p>
      <p begin="00:42:44.40" id="p329" end="00:42:49.12">and highly specialised way<br />to gather every nourishing scrap.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:53.64" id="p330" end="00:42:59.12">Christmas tree worms bore into<br />the coral's skeleton for protection,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:59.12" id="p331" end="00:43:03.24">swirling out and grabbing food<br />particles with their feathery gills.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:05.52" id="p332" end="00:43:08.72">Coral barnacles are, in fact,<br />related to lobsters.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:08.72" id="p333" end="00:43:10.00">They lie on their backs,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:10.00" id="p334" end="00:43:14.04">waving their feet to gather<br />any food floating past.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:21.96" id="p335" end="00:43:25.64">Crabs have evolved many different<br />ways of gathering food.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:27.48" id="p336" end="00:43:33.00">This porcelain crab has<br />a fan of filaments on his front legs.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:37.32" id="p337" end="00:43:41.56">A boxer crab attaches<br />a tiny sea anemone to each fist.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:41.56" id="p338" end="00:43:45.32">As well as for defence,<br />he uses their sticky tentacles</p>
      <p begin="00:43:45.32" id="p339" end="00:43:47.48">to gather passing plankton.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:51.56" id="p340" end="00:43:55.88">This orangutan crab's whole body<br />is coated with sticky hairs,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:55.88" id="p341" end="00:43:58.88">in this case,<br />perhaps just a bit too sticky!</p>
      <p begin="00:44:24.40" id="p342" end="00:44:28.40">This strange creature<br />is a sea cucumber.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:28.40" id="p343" end="00:44:32.48">It uses its tentacles to grab food<br />from the sediment.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:34.12" id="p344" end="00:44:36.24">There are hunters here too,</p>
      <p begin="00:44:36.24" id="p345" end="00:44:39.44">like these nudibranchs, or sea slugs.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:40.44" id="p346" end="00:44:43.64">Their vibrant colours are a warning<br />that they're toxic.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:43.64" id="p347" end="00:44:49.44">There are over 3,000 species,<br />many hunt just one specific prey.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:49.44" id="p348" end="00:44:53.08">Some hunt each other.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:57.32" id="p349" end="00:45:02.16">This emperor shrimp makes the most<br />of the poisonous nature of its host.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:02.16" id="p350" end="00:45:05.48">But, it's a rather one-sided affair.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:05.48" id="p351" end="00:45:09.44">As it feeds, the shrimp<br />gets protection and a free ride.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:15.64" id="p352" end="00:45:19.72">Other shrimps have developed<br />a more balanced relationship.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:19.72" id="p353" end="00:45:22.52">Some even solicit for partners.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:24.16" id="p354" end="00:45:27.08">These dance for their dinner.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:35.96" id="p355" end="00:45:40.40">And these advertise to passers-by</p>
      <p begin="00:45:40.40" id="p356" end="00:45:42.52">that they are open for business.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:44.68" id="p357" end="00:45:47.64">They are a parasite removal team,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:47.64" id="p358" end="00:45:50.36">providing a service<br />for countless fish on the reef,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:50.36" id="p359" end="00:45:54.40">including those<br />that could happily eat them.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:02.00" id="p360" end="00:46:06.40">In return for their bravery,<br />they get a meal that comes to them.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:26.36" id="p361" end="00:46:30.04">Coral reefs,<br />built by the tiniest of creatures,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:30.04" id="p362" end="00:46:34.32">occupy less than half of one per cent<br />of the ocean's floor.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:36.16" id="p363" end="00:46:41.12">Yet they support a quarter<br />of all marine species.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:15.56" id="p364" end="00:47:18.84">Marine creatures,<br />all without backbones,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:18.84" id="p365" end="00:47:21.68">from corals, to cuttlefish, to crabs,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:21.68" id="p366" end="00:47:26.08">make up the majority of life<br />in the oceans.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:26.08" id="p367" end="00:47:30.00">But they have also had<br />a surprisingly important impact</p>
      <p begin="00:47:30.00" id="p368" end="00:47:32.60">beyond the marine world.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:33.56" id="p369" end="00:47:36.80">Their fossilised bodies, shells<br />and skeletons</p>
      <p begin="00:47:36.80" id="p370" end="00:47:40.80">form the limestone and chalk<br />that now covers huge tracts</p>
      <p begin="00:47:40.80" id="p371" end="00:47:43.92">of Asia, Europe, and the Americas.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:43.92" id="p372" end="00:47:48.56">They may be small, but over<br />their two billion-year history,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:48.56" id="p373" end="00:47:53.16">they have, literally,<br />changed the world.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:01.24" id="p374" end="00:48:04.16">To capture some of the sequences<br />in this episode,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:04.16" id="p375" end="00:48:09.72">the Life team had to take underwater<br />filming into uncharted territory.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:10.96" id="p376" end="00:48:15.28">One shoot meant spending weeks diving<br />under two metres of ice,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:15.28" id="p377" end="00:48:19.32">another involved laying<br />the foundation for a new coral reef</p>
      <p begin="00:48:19.32" id="p378" end="00:48:20.36">in the tropics.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:26.56" id="p379" end="00:48:31.52">A sunken ship can make<br />an ideal location for corals to grow.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:31.52" id="p380" end="00:48:32.72">So, with this in mind,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:32.72" id="p381" end="00:48:36.00">the Life team set themselves<br />a challenge...</p>
      <p begin="00:48:36.00" id="p382" end="00:48:38.28">to make their very own shipwreck.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:41.68" id="p383" end="00:48:43.56">After months of searching,</p>
      <p begin="00:48:43.56" id="p384" end="00:48:46.44">they find a boat in the Bahamas<br />that might be suitable.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:46.44" id="p385" end="00:48:49.76">But there's a lot to do<br />before it can be sunk to the sea bed.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:48:49.76" id="p386" end="00:48:52.44">Apparently it's been here<br />for eight years on the jetty.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:48:52.44" id="p387" end="00:48:57.44">All this fibreglass insulation<br />has all got to be removed</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:48:57.44" id="p388" end="00:48:59.40">and it's all hands to the pump, Ian.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:48:59.40" id="p389" end="00:49:01.36">We've got to get<br />a pair of overalls.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:01.36" id="p390" end="00:49:05.96">The team have to put away their<br />cameras and get their hands dirty.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:49:06.96" id="p391" end="00:49:08.32">I've got a 50-tonne boat,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:49:08.32" id="p392" end="00:49:10.80">and I'm trying to clean it<br />with a paint scraper!</p>
      <p begin="00:49:10.80" id="p393" end="00:49:12.88">Thoroughly cleaning the boat</p>
      <p begin="00:49:12.88" id="p394" end="00:49:15.32">increases the chance<br />that coral will grow on it,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:15.32" id="p395" end="00:49:17.20">and ensures it won't pollute the sea.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:49:17.20" id="p396" end="00:49:20.20">It's like Changing Rooms, isn't it?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:20.20" id="p397" end="00:49:22.72">After eight years rusting<br />on the jetty,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:22.72" id="p398" end="00:49:25.40">there's no guarantee<br />that she'll even float.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:49:25.40" id="p399" end="00:49:29.20">Well, we actually...<br />we do have some holes.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:49:29.20" id="p400" end="00:49:31.16">All up!</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:49:31.16" id="p401" end="00:49:35.56">To get this ship ready in time for<br />the inspectors is a massive task,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:49:35.56" id="p402" end="00:49:38.08">and they've been doing<br />a brilliant job.</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:49:52.32" id="p407" end="00:49:56.80">Well, she's clean,<br />she's been inspected,<br />and she's ready to be sunk.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:49:56.80" id="p408" end="00:49:59.84">What can go wrong now?</p>
      <p begin="00:49:59.84" id="p409" end="00:50:03.08">TELEVISION: <span tts:color="lime">'Here's the very latest<br />with Dean...'</span></p>
      <p begin="00:50:03.08" id="p410" end="00:50:06.32">As the tail end of Hurricane Dean<br />sweeps through,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:06.32" id="p411" end="00:50:09.24">the team are forced<br />to put their plans on hold.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:09.24" id="p412" end="00:50:12.08">TELEVISION: <span tts:color="lime">'..winds of 150<br />miles an hour...'</span></p>
      <p begin="00:50:13.24" id="p413" end="00:50:16.16">Luck doesn't seem<br />to be on their side.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:23.12" id="p414" end="00:50:26.04">But, two days later,<br />good weather returns.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:50:26.04" id="p415" end="00:50:28.76">Here comes a crane, finally!</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:50:31.76" id="p416" end="00:50:35.08">Fingers crossed, arms crossed,<br />legs crossed, everything's crossed!</p>
      <p begin="00:50:35.08" id="p417" end="00:50:38.60">They urgently need<br />to get the boat into the water,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:38.60" id="p418" end="00:50:42.68">or they won't reach the chosen<br />wreck site before nightfall.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:45.08" id="p419" end="00:50:47.64">She's safely in the water,<br />so far, so good.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:50:47.64" id="p420" end="00:50:49.72">It floats!</p>
      <p begin="00:50:51.84" id="p421" end="00:50:54.60">Her final voyage...</p>
      <p begin="00:50:54.60" id="p422" end="00:50:57.64">Cameras are mounted around the deck,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:57.64" id="p423" end="00:51:00.40">to film her sinking<br />below the surface.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:51:00.40" id="p424" end="00:51:05.00">We've spent a week<br />preparing for this,<br />and finally the afternoon's arrived.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:51:05.00" id="p425" end="00:51:07.16">But the light's going,<br />so we have to move.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:09.92" id="p426" end="00:51:14.44">A last few holes are cut.<br />It's time to pump in water,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:14.44" id="p427" end="00:51:16.84">and to abandon ship.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:20.60" id="p428" end="00:51:22.16">The crew dive in,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:22.16" id="p429" end="00:51:27.56">ready to film her descent,<br />while the support boat<br />moves away to a safe distance.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:28.68" id="p430" end="00:51:30.64">There's nothing more to do, but wait.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:51:30.64" id="p431" end="00:51:33.32">Here we go, look at this!</p>
      <p begin="00:52:01.36" id="p432" end="00:52:07.04">She gently comes to rest, and the<br />right way up, just as they'd hoped.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:17.76" id="p433" end="00:52:20.64">Now, it's time to let nature<br />take its course.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:20.64" id="p434" end="00:52:24.88">The crew will be back over the next<br />two years to see how life takes hold.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:26.16" id="p435" end="00:52:29.04">At this site, the wreck<br />has a very good chance</p>
      <p begin="00:52:29.04" id="p436" end="00:52:31.20">that it'll be colonised by coral.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:31.20" id="p437" end="00:52:36.00">With luck and time, it'll eventually<br />become a full-scale reef.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:38.84" id="p438" end="00:52:41.48">Meanwhile, at the other end<br />of the world,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:41.48" id="p439" end="00:52:44.76">the Life team's challenge<br />is very different.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:48.20" id="p440" end="00:52:52.84">Here in Antarctica, just getting<br />underwater will be tough.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:57.44" id="p441" end="00:52:59.92">In order to work<br />in such a demanding location,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:59.92" id="p442" end="00:53:03.12">the team needed the help<br />of the National Science Foundation,</p>
      <p begin="00:53:03.12" id="p443" end="00:53:06.44">at the McMurdo<br />polar research station.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:11.00" id="p444" end="00:53:15.00">Everyone here has to be able to cope<br />out on the ice</p>
      <p begin="00:53:15.00" id="p445" end="00:53:16.48">if there's an emergency.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:16.48" id="p446" end="00:53:21.28">So the Life team joins research<br />scientists for survival training,</p>
      <p begin="00:53:21.28" id="p447" end="00:53:24.00">to prepare them for any situation.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:25.80" id="p448" end="00:53:28.48">Even one like this.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:37.16" id="p449" end="00:53:40.28">A colleague lost in a whiteout<br />is very serious.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:40.28" id="p450" end="00:53:44.92">This training might mean the<br />difference between rescue, or not.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:44.92" id="p451" end="00:53:48.28">This is supposed<br />to simulate a whiteout,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:48.28" id="p452" end="00:53:51.28">we've been looking for someone<br />who's been lost, and you wear</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:51.28" id="p453" end="00:53:55.92">the bucket so you cannot see at all,<br />and it does actually work.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:55.92" id="p454" end="00:53:59.12">It's just...<br />You can't see anything in this.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:02.20" id="p455" end="00:54:06.40">With the training over, it's time to<br />travel over the ice to the dive site,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:06.40" id="p456" end="00:54:10.40">ready to go beneath<br />the frozen surface of the Ross Sea.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:13.20" id="p457" end="00:54:17.36">But to get through this ice,<br />thick enough to land a jet on,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:17.36" id="p458" end="00:54:20.92">needs the help of McMurdo's<br />specialist drilling team.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:44.92" id="p459" end="00:54:47.92">Once the hole is drilled,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:47.92" id="p460" end="00:54:51.88">a specially designed hut<br />is slid into position.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:56.32" id="p461" end="00:55:00.44">This will be the team's base<br />for the next four weeks of diving.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:02.00" id="p462" end="00:55:06.32">Look, this is all we need,<br />all we need to go in here...</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:06.32" id="p463" end="00:55:09.64">the door to another world.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:09.64" id="p464" end="00:55:12.08">All the equipment the team need<br />for the shots</p>
      <p begin="00:55:12.08" id="p465" end="00:55:14.12">must come in and out of this hole.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:14.12" id="p466" end="00:55:17.12">This is as far south<br />as it's possible to dive.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:17.12" id="p467" end="00:55:22.76">The ice, eight feet thick, it's<br />here for 11&#189; months of the year,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:22.76" id="p468" end="00:55:25.52">and we're goin go down underneath<br />and have a look,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:25.52" id="p469" end="00:55:28.20">to see just what it's like<br />underneath there.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:28.20" id="p470" end="00:55:31.60">Doug and the team<br />venture below the ice.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:02.00" id="p471" end="00:56:07.16">The under-ice landscape is both<br />surprising and spectacular,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:07.16" id="p472" end="00:56:10.16">but it's the animals<br />they've come to film.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:13.56" id="p473" end="00:56:18.24">So, specialist time-lapse cameras<br />are moved into position.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:24.96" id="p474" end="00:56:28.92">The animals move very slowly<br />at these freezing temperatures.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:28.92" id="p475" end="00:56:33.44">But by using time-lapse to speed up<br />the action 500 times,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:33.44" id="p476" end="00:56:39.92">the team hopes to reveal<br />the behaviour of these creatures<br />for the first time.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:50.64" id="p477" end="00:56:54.32">With air and warmth running out<br />for this dive,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:54.32" id="p478" end="00:56:57.16">Doug makes his way<br />back to the lifeline,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:57.16" id="p479" end="00:56:58.64">and the surface.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:57:19.48" id="p480" end="00:57:24.52">Oh! That is amazing.<br />It is so beautiful down there.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:57:24.52" id="p481" end="00:57:29.12">All sorts of colours, beautiful<br />stalactites made of ice crystals</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:57:29.12" id="p482" end="00:57:31.52">hanging down from<br />the top of the ice.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:57:31.52" id="p483" end="00:57:34.72">All sorts of things on the bottom,<br />starfish, urchins,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:57:34.72" id="p484" end="00:57:36.64">just an amazing profusion of life.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:57:36.64" id="p485" end="00:57:39.96">Really lovely, totally unique,<br />unlike anywhere else.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:57:39.96" id="p486" end="00:57:44.08">However, after an hour underwater<br />it is getting pretty cold,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:57:44.08" id="p487" end="00:57:47.36">so can you give me<br />a hand up, please? Thanks.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:49.72" id="p488" end="00:57:54.00">There would be another month here,<br />and over 100 dives,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:54.00" id="p489" end="00:57:57.24">before the sequence<br />was eventually completed.</p>
