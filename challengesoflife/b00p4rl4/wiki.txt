[[Marine invertebrate]]s, the descendants of one billion years of evolutionary history, are the most abundant creatures in the ocean. In the [[Sea of Cortez]], packs of [[Humboldt squid]] make night-time raids from the deep to co-operatively hunt [[sardine]]s. Beneath the permanent Antarctic [[sea ice]] of [[McMurdo Sound]], [[sea urchin]]s, red [[sea star]]s and [[nemertean worm]]s are filmed scavenging on a [[Pinniped|seal]] carcass. A [[fried egg jellyfish]] hunts amongst a swarm of [[Aurelia]] in the open ocean, spearing its prey with harpoon-like tentacles. In the shallows off [[South Australia]], hundreds of thousands of [[Majidae|spider crab]]s gather annually to moult. Many invertebrates have simple nervous systems, but [[Australian Giant Cuttlefish|giant cuttlefish]] have large brains and complex mating habits. Large males use flashing stroboscopic colours and strength to win a mate, whereas smaller rivals rely on deceit: both tactics are successful. A [[North Pacific Giant Octopus|Pacific giant octopus]] sacrifices her life to tend her single clutch of eggs for six months. As a [[Pycnopodia]] starfish feeds on her remains, it comes under attack from a [[king crab]]. [[Coral reef]]s, which rival rainforests in their diversity, are the largest living structures on Earth and are created by coral [[polyp]]s. [[Porcelain crab]]s, [[boxer crab]]s and orangutan crabs are shown to illustrate the many specialised ways of catching food on a reef. Marine invertebrates have a lasting legacy on land too â€“ their shells formed the [[chalk]] and [[limestone]] deposits of [[Eurasia]] and the Americas. ''Life on Location'' documents the recording of Antarctic sea life and the birth of a reef.<ref name=bbc-episode-8>{{cite episode |title= Creatures of the Deep |series=Life |credits=Produced by Neil Lucas |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-11-30|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p4rl4}}</ref>
