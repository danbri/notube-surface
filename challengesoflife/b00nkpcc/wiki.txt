Intelligence, warm blood and strong family bonds have made [[mammal]]s the most successful group of animals on the planet: they can even survive the [[Antarctic]] winter. Here, a [[Weddell seal]] leads her pup on its first swim beneath the ice. In [[East Africa]], a [[Rufous Elephant Shrew|rufous sengi]] uses a mental map of the pathways it has cleared to outwit a chasing lizard. A young [[aye-aye]] takes four years to learn how to find and extract [[beetle]] grubs, food no other mammal can reach. [[Reindeer]] move through the [[Arctic]] [[tundra]], making the longest overland migration of any animal. Other mammals have evolved different ways of travelling long distances: ten million [[fruit bat]]s congregate at [[Zambia]]'s [[Kasanka National Park|Kasanka]] swamps to gorge on fruiting trees. Mammals employ different strategies to find food. At night on the African [[savannah]], [[hyena]]s force [[lion]]s off a kill through sheer weight of numbers, whilst in the melting Arctic, dozens of [[polar bear]]s take advantage of a [[bowhead whale]] carcass. Raising young is another important factor in mammals' success. [[Coati]]s and [[meerkat]]s form social groups to share the burden of childcare. A first-time [[African elephant]] mother needs the experience of the herd's matriarch to get her young calf out of trouble. The largest animals in the ocean are also mammals. The seas around [[Tonga]] are both a nursery and mating ground for [[humpback whale]]s. A female leads her potential suitors on a chase, the males battling for dominance behind her. ''Life on Location'' follows the never-before filmed humpback heat run.<ref name=bbc-episode-3>{{cite episode |title=Mammals |series=Life |credits=Produced by Ted Oakes |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-10-26|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nkpcc}}</ref>
