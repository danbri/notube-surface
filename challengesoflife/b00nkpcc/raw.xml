      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:28.16" id="p0" end="00:00:29.72">Antarctica.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:29.72" id="p1" end="00:00:33.52">The earth's coldest continent,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:33.52" id="p2" end="00:00:36.96">the one that is most hostile<br />to life.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:43.36" id="p3" end="00:00:46.64">Here, 800 miles from the South Pole,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:46.64" id="p4" end="00:00:49.16">it's 40 degrees below zero.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:53.32" id="p5" end="00:00:56.96">Of all the millions of<br />species of animals on Earth,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:56.96" id="p6" end="00:01:00.08">only one can live here permanently.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:09.72" id="p7" end="00:01:11.24">A Weddell seal.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:15.08" id="p8" end="00:01:20.68">She can survive<br />because she can dive below the ice.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:24.16" id="p9" end="00:01:27.04">Here she is protected<br />from the storms above,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:27.04" id="p10" end="00:01:29.88">and here too, she can find food.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:49.56" id="p11" end="00:01:54.40">But she is a mammal,<br />and she has to breathe air,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:54.40" id="p12" end="00:01:58.52">so she has to keep a lifeline open<br />to the world above the ice.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:00.12" id="p13" end="00:02:02.20">Not only for her,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:02.20" id="p14" end="00:02:05.00">but now for her newborn pup.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:05.00" id="p15" end="00:02:06.08">SEAL GRUNTS</p>
      <p begin="00:02:06.08" id="p16" end="00:02:07.48">PUP CRIES</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:09.48" id="p17" end="00:02:12.88">He's less than a week old,<br />and still very vulnerable.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:24.72" id="p18" end="00:02:28.52">A blizzard blows in,<br />and with it, storm-force winds.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:28.52" id="p19" end="00:02:30.20">It could last for a week.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:40.68" id="p20" end="00:02:45.48">Being mammals, seals can generate<br />heat within their bodies.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:45.48" id="p21" end="00:02:49.08">And their fur, with<br />a thick layer of fat beneath it,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:49.08" id="p22" end="00:02:51.40">prevents most<br />of that heat from escaping,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:51.40" id="p23" end="00:02:54.00">even in cold conditions like this.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:59.96" id="p24" end="00:03:03.44">What is more,<br />she is able to feed her youngster</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:03.44" id="p25" end="00:03:07.92">with that mammalian speciality,<br />milk.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:07.92" id="p26" end="00:03:11.96">And while she does so, she shields<br />him from the worst of the blizzard.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:37.08" id="p27" end="00:03:41.20">She has worked hard throughout the<br />winter to prevent her breathing hole</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:41.20" id="p28" end="00:03:43.08">in the ice from freezing over.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:54.08" id="p29" end="00:03:56.64">That requires constant attention -</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:56.64" id="p30" end="00:03:59.68">filing back the edges<br />of the hole with her teeth.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:07.16" id="p31" end="00:04:11.64">Her pup needs to join her under the<br />ice as soon as he can swim properly.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:15.96" id="p32" end="00:04:18.96">She encourages him<br />to take his first plunge, but,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:18.96" id="p33" end="00:04:21.20">hardly surprisingly, he is not keen.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:43.48" id="p34" end="00:04:48.96">Now, guided by his mother, he has<br />to learn how to hunt underwater,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:48.96" id="p35" end="00:04:52.92">and to find his way back through<br />the maze to his hole in the ice.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:08.80" id="p36" end="00:05:14.48">A warm body, fur, milk<br />and maternal care are essential</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:14.48" id="p37" end="00:05:18.28">for the Weddell seal's survival<br />in this freezing environment.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:20.96" id="p38" end="00:05:24.28">And those qualities<br />have helped the mammals</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:24.28" id="p39" end="00:05:27.28">to colonise the entire globe.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:36.88" id="p40" end="00:05:38.88">Equatorial East Africa.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:40.40" id="p41" end="00:05:44.40">It's hard to image a place<br />more different from Antarctica.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:46.64" id="p42" end="00:05:51.24">To survive here,<br />mammals need additional talents.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:53.40" id="p43" end="00:05:57.40">This tree shelters<br />the territory of a tiny mammal</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:57.40" id="p44" end="00:06:01.56">that spends its whole life<br />in frenzied activity.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:03.60" id="p45" end="00:06:06.12">It used to be called<br />an elephant shrew,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:06.12" id="p46" end="00:06:09.88">but now it's called by<br />its African name of sengi.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:16.24" id="p47" end="00:06:20.20">This is a female rufous sengi.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:22.12" id="p48" end="00:06:26.76">And, like all sengis, she's so<br />active, she's permanently hungry.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:29.04" id="p49" end="00:06:31.36">To get all the food she needs,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:31.36" id="p50" end="00:06:34.88">she has to be both<br />industrious and ingenious.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:41.36" id="p51" end="00:06:44.04">She has made<br />an intricate network of trails</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:44.04" id="p52" end="00:06:49.28">that enable her to hunt<br />her insect prey very efficiently.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:50.32" id="p53" end="00:06:54.48">But these pathways<br />have another important function</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:54.48" id="p54" end="00:06:56.56">when she meets her enemies.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:28.68" id="p55" end="00:07:32.48">Having a map of these trails<br />in her head can mean the difference</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:32.48" id="p56" end="00:07:33.96">between life...</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:36.00" id="p57" end="00:07:37.04">..and death.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:42.84" id="p58" end="00:07:45.96">Like most mammals,<br />and unlike reptiles,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:45.96" id="p59" end="00:07:48.64">her legs are directly<br />beneath her body.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:49.68" id="p60" end="00:07:53.72">That makes her less stable,<br />but much faster and more agile.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:12.44" id="p61" end="00:08:17.56">Not only has she outrun<br />this reptile, she's outwitted him.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:23.00" id="p62" end="00:08:24.68">And just as well,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:24.68" id="p63" end="00:08:28.36">for she is a mother<br />and has a youngster to care for.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:37.76" id="p64" end="00:08:41.76">The sengi relies on speed<br />and cunning for its success.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:41.76" id="p65" end="00:08:44.92">Other mammals have<br />very different techniques.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:49.84" id="p66" end="00:08:53.12">ANIMALS CALL OUT</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:53.12" id="p67" end="00:08:54.80">Here in Madagascar,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:54.80" id="p68" end="00:08:59.32">one of the most bizarre<br />of all mammals is on the prowl.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:07.12" id="p69" end="00:09:10.48">The aye-aye, like the sengi,<br />lives on insects.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:11.92" id="p70" end="00:09:15.20">But the ones that she seeks,<br />she can't see,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:15.20" id="p71" end="00:09:18.20">for they're buried<br />deep inside branches.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:18.20" id="p72" end="00:09:20.56">They're beetle grubs.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:23.68" id="p73" end="00:09:27.68">To find them,<br />she has a special talent.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:27.68" id="p74" end="00:09:31.00">She taps her fingers on the<br />wood up to eight times a second,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:31.00" id="p75" end="00:09:33.72">and listens<br />for the tiny change in resonance</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:33.72" id="p76" end="00:09:37.40">that indicates a hollow spot within.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:37.40" id="p77" end="00:09:41.64">Her hearing is so acute, she can<br />identify the precise position</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:41.64" id="p78" end="00:09:45.04">in which to gnaw a hole<br />in order to reach the grub.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:47.24" id="p79" end="00:09:51.16">And she has a grotesquely<br />long middle finger</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:51.16" id="p80" end="00:09:52.96">with which to skewer it.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:04.40" id="p81" end="00:10:10.20">It takes a young aye-aye four<br />years to perfect this technique.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:10.20" id="p82" end="00:10:12.44">But once it has done so,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:12.44" id="p83" end="00:10:15.96">it can collect prey<br />that no other mammal can reach.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:35.48" id="p84" end="00:10:37.04">The Arctic tundra.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:37.04" id="p85" end="00:10:40.00">Food is hard to find here too.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:40.00" id="p86" end="00:10:43.76">Indeed, this land is so barren<br />that few large animals can live<br />here.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:47.00" id="p87" end="00:10:50.40">Yet one mammal<br />has found a way to do so.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:02.36" id="p88" end="00:11:03.64">It's late spring,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:03.64" id="p89" end="00:11:07.40">and as the mounting strength<br />of the sun warms the land,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:07.40" id="p90" end="00:11:10.64">eight million reindeer move north.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:22.12" id="p91" end="00:11:24.04">But the vegetation is so meagre</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:24.04" id="p92" end="00:11:26.56">that the only way the herds<br />can get enough</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:26.56" id="p93" end="00:11:29.36">is to keep constantly on the move.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:36.60" id="p94" end="00:11:38.64">Newborn calves soon discover</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:38.64" id="p95" end="00:11:42.96">that they will have to spend<br />every day walking in search of food.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:45.12" id="p96" end="00:11:47.48">They have extraordinary endurance.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:47.48" id="p97" end="00:11:50.24">Some of these animals,<br />before they die,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:50.24" id="p98" end="00:11:52.48">will have trekked for a distance</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:52.48" id="p99" end="00:11:55.92">equivalent to three times<br />around the earth.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:59.52" id="p100" end="00:12:02.24">Grazing is now at its best.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:02.24" id="p101" end="00:12:06.44">But this also the time when the<br />reindeer' worst enemy appears...</p>
      <p begin="00:12:07.60" id="p102" end="00:12:09.04">BUZZING</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:09.04" id="p103" end="00:12:10.80">Biting flies.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:13.08" id="p104" end="00:12:15.76">The flies not<br />only drive them to distraction,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:15.76" id="p105" end="00:12:19.44">but they can drain<br />a pint of blood each day.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:29.36" id="p106" end="00:12:33.16">But the reindeer<br />have a defensive strategy.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:39.00" id="p107" end="00:12:43.00">Each individual tries to push<br />its way into the centre of a group</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:43.00" id="p108" end="00:12:44.80">where there are fewer flies.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:01.64" id="p109" end="00:13:03.84">With all this pushing and jostling,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:03.84" id="p110" end="00:13:06.60">mothers need<br />to keep their calves close.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:13.96" id="p111" end="00:13:16.64">Sometimes the flies become so bad</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:16.64" id="p112" end="00:13:18.68">the reindeer<br />can stand them no longer</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:18.68" id="p113" end="00:13:22.84">and they bolt to higher ground<br />where the flies can't follow.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:18.88" id="p114" end="00:14:21.76">But the price of escape can be high.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:24.08" id="p115" end="00:14:27.28">In the rush,<br />one mother has lost her calf.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:29.60" id="p116" end="00:14:31.64">REINDEER CALLS OUT</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:51.96" id="p117" end="00:14:54.20">Others have already found it.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:55.52" id="p118" end="00:14:57.56">BIRDS CALL OUT</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:09.16" id="p119" end="00:15:11.52">The herd has long since moved on,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:11.52" id="p120" end="00:15:14.64">but her maternal instinct<br />is so strong</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:14.64" id="p121" end="00:15:18.76">she'll stay to search<br />for her missing calf for days.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:21.96" id="p122" end="00:15:25.68">The reindeer are free<br />from flies for now,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:25.68" id="p123" end="00:15:29.08">but with no food<br />on these high slopes,</p>

      <p style="s3" begin="00:51:42.16" id="p385" end="00:51:44.16">It's just a baby.<br />Like a little puppy,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:51:44.16" id="p386" end="00:51:47.40">you're playing with a little<br />puppy, but it's four metres long.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:47.40" id="p387" end="00:51:51.28"><span tts:color="lime">It's just ludicrous.<br /></span><span tts:color="cyan">Was his mum all right?</span></p>
      <p begin="00:51:51.28" id="p388" end="00:51:53.72">She is just totally<br />chilling out underneath.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:53.72" id="p389" end="00:51:57.96">Pecs back. Just hanging like this<br />at about 15 metres.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:57.96" id="p390" end="00:51:59.36">Yeah, just hanging there.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:59.36" id="p391" end="00:52:01.68">Probably didn't even see it,<br />I don't think.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:52:04.88" id="p392" end="00:52:07.44">It's one thing to be close<br />to a playful baby.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:52:07.44" id="p393" end="00:52:09.72">It will be another to be in the path</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:52:09.72" id="p394" end="00:52:12.76">of a testosterone-charged<br />group of males,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:52:12.76" id="p395" end="00:52:16.00">each ten times her size.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:16.00" id="p396" end="00:52:18.48">MUTTERED CONVERSATION</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:52:21.36" id="p397" end="00:52:26.32">There are enough males here for a<br />heat run, but are they in the mood?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:27.28" id="p398" end="00:52:28.68">Oh!</p>
      <p begin="00:52:28.68" id="p399" end="00:52:30.48"><span tts:color="cyan">Woo-hoo! </span>Yes!</p>
      <p begin="00:52:33.68" id="p400" end="00:52:34.84">That was pretty good.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:52:38.52" id="p401" end="00:52:39.80">When you guys are ready.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:52:41.48" id="p402" end="00:52:42.52">Quick as you can.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:51.28" id="p403" end="00:52:55.04">These whales can weigh up to 40<br />tonnes and move surprisingly quickly.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:55.04" id="p404" end="00:52:57.44">As well as getting<br />the camera to get the shots -</p>
      <p begin="00:52:57.44" id="p405" end="00:52:58.96">they have to be fairly close -</p>
      <p begin="00:52:58.96" id="p406" end="00:53:01.32">we have to be careful<br />they don't get bumped.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:01.32" id="p407" end="00:53:03.56">If they get a knock<br />from one of these guys,</p>
      <p begin="00:53:03.56" id="p408" end="00:53:05.68">it could do some serious damage.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:53:12.24" id="p409" end="00:53:13.52">He's right towards you.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:13.52" id="p410" end="00:53:16.64">To avoid disturbing<br />the whales' behaviour,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:16.64" id="p411" end="00:53:22.12">the team need to free-dive,<br />without scuba tanks,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:22.12" id="p412" end="00:53:24.28">holding their breath<br />as long as they can.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:24.28" id="p413" end="00:53:28.72">On a good dive, I can hold my<br />breath for maybe two minutes.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:28.72" id="p414" end="00:53:31.08">These guys,<br />they can go for 20 minutes or more</p>
      <p begin="00:53:31.08" id="p415" end="00:53:33.08">before they have to come up for air.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:33.08" id="p416" end="00:53:34.80">There's no contest.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:34.80" id="p417" end="00:53:37.36">More and more whales are gathering,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:37.36" id="p418" end="00:53:40.56">but it's not turning<br />into a heat run yet.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:48.32" id="p419" end="00:53:50.44">Hard to say what's going on.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:51.96" id="p420" end="00:53:54.52">Were there five that time?</p>
      <p begin="00:53:56.60" id="p421" end="00:54:00.00">They're kind of moving around,<br />coming up and under and over.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:00.00" id="p422" end="00:54:02.40">Hopefully,<br />something's starting to happen.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:02.40" id="p423" end="00:54:03.84">Maybe love's in the air?</p>
      <p begin="00:54:03.84" id="p424" end="00:54:05.52">HE CHUCKLES</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:09.44" id="p425" end="00:54:13.48">Love may be in the air,<br />but it isn't in the water.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:13.48" id="p426" end="00:54:17.24">Despite keeping tabs on the whales<br />over the next ten days,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:17.24" id="p427" end="00:54:19.92">there was still no sign<br />of a heat run starting.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:19.92" id="p428" end="00:54:23.32">You'd think it'd be quite easy<br />to keep track of a 40-tonne animal.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:23.32" id="p429" end="00:54:26.36">And we've got six of them out here,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:26.36" id="p430" end="00:54:29.20">and we keep losing them.<br />One minute they're there,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:29.20" id="p431" end="00:54:30.80">we get up reasonably close,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:30.80" id="p432" end="00:54:34.32">and within 30 seconds, they've dived<br />and they're gone again.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:34.32" id="p433" end="00:54:37.68">And then it takes another<br />maybe five minutes, ten minutes,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:37.68" id="p434" end="00:54:41.04">and then they'll come up again<br />and they'll be 300 yards away,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:41.04" id="p435" end="00:54:43.40">and it takes ages<br />just to get close to them.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:43.40" id="p436" end="00:54:47.84">So we're just playing<br />a continuous game of cat and mouse.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:49.36" id="p437" end="00:54:52.20">Cat and mouse? It's whales.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:53.84" id="p438" end="00:54:56.12">The mating season<br />is coming to an end,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:56.12" id="p439" end="00:54:59.00">and the crew haven't<br />completed their mission.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:59.00" id="p440" end="00:55:03.76">But then, at last, the whales'<br />behaviour seems to have changed.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:05.28" id="p441" end="00:55:06.32">Well, this is it!</p>
      <p begin="00:55:06.32" id="p442" end="00:55:09.76">We just spotted about six<br />or seven humpbacks on the horizon.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:09.76" id="p443" end="00:55:11.20">We think it's a heat run.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:11.20" id="p444" end="00:55:14.44">The last 16, 17 days on the water</p>
      <p begin="00:55:14.44" id="p445" end="00:55:17.20">are probably gonna come down<br />to the next two hours,</p>
      <p begin="00:55:17.20" id="p446" end="00:55:19.24">as to whether<br />we get our shots or not.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:19.24" id="p447" end="00:55:21.28">The chase is on!</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:55:48.32" id="p448" end="00:55:51.00">There was at least<br />three or four males going past -</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:55:51.00" id="p449" end="00:55:53.68">they were competing<br />and knocking into each other</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:55:53.68" id="p450" end="00:55:56.72">as they tried to get the poll<br />position behind the female.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:55:56.72" id="p451" end="00:55:59.44">It's right at you,<br />it's right at you.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:59.44" id="p452" end="00:56:03.92">The whales are moving so fast that,<br />to stand any chance of filming them,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:56:03.92" id="p453" end="00:56:07.80">the crew needs to be dropped right<br />in front of the charging group.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:56:22.88" id="p454" end="00:56:25.24">Just as Roger<br />gets alongside the males,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:56:25.24" id="p455" end="00:56:28.44">the tempo of the chase suddenly<br />shifts to full bore</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:56:28.44" id="p456" end="00:56:29.76">with a flick of a tail.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:56:44.96" id="p457" end="00:56:49.32">Facing the charging males deep<br />underwater, Roger keeps shooting,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:56:49.32" id="p458" end="00:56:51.88">holding his breath<br />until the group pass over.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:57:00.64" id="p459" end="00:57:04.40">A quick gasp of air,<br />and Roger's back down again.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:57:14.32" id="p460" end="00:57:17.20">The whales continue to rush by.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:57:17.20" id="p461" end="00:57:20.84">In the end,<br />Roger just can't keep up any longer.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:57:27.52" id="p462" end="00:57:33.12">Exhausted, it's time to return<br />to the boat for the last time.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:33.12" id="p463" end="00:57:36.84">Amazing! That was the most<br />amazing experience I've ever had.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:36.84" id="p464" end="00:57:38.40">There was about...</p>
      <p begin="00:57:38.40" id="p465" end="00:57:43.68">seven or eight. Both dived<br />down about 20 metres in front.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:43.68" id="p466" end="00:57:47.00">And then the female came<br />through first, quite close.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:47.00" id="p467" end="00:57:49.96">And then they all just<br />started diving towards me,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:49.96" id="p468" end="00:57:52.40">it was like standing<br />in a stream of traffic.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:52.40" id="p469" end="00:57:55.56">It was just one one side, one<br />the next side, one the next side.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:55.56" id="p470" end="00:57:57.48">And then, after about 40 seconds,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:57.48" id="p471" end="00:58:01.04">40, 45 seconds, I was getting<br />a little bit out of breath.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:01.04" id="p472" end="00:58:06.48">And then I looked up, and there's<br />one sitting right on top of me.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:06.48" id="p473" end="00:58:09.20"><span tts:color="cyan">Did you get it? </span>I think so. Hope so.</p>
      <p begin="00:58:09.20" id="p474" end="00:58:11.80">If not, then we're both fired!</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:58:13.72" id="p475" end="00:58:18.44">It's taken 18 days<br />and hundreds of dives,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:58:18.44" id="p476" end="00:58:21.28">but at last the team<br />have been able to reveal a secret</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:58:21.28" id="p477" end="00:58:25.56">of these whales' lives<br />that few people have ever seen.</p>
