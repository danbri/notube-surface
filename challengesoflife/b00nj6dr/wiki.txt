In the opening sequence, an aerial camera zooms in on a solitary [[Komodo dragon]] from afar. This, states Attenborough, is the last place on Earth still ruled by [[reptile]]s. Though they may seem primitive, reptiles and [[amphibian]]s still thrive thanks to diverse survival strategies. In [[Venezuela]], a [[pebble toad]] evades a [[tarantula]] by free-falling down a steep rock face. The basilisk, nicknamed the [[Plumed basilisk|Jesus Christ lizard]], can literally run on water and the [[Brazil]]ian [[Coleodactylus|pygmy gecko]] is so light it does not break the surface. Reptiles are [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]], and some have developed unusual strategies to absorb heat. [[Namaqua Chameleon|Namaqua chameleon]]s darken the skin of the side of their body facing the sun. A male [[Common Garter Snake|red-sided garter snake]] masquerades as a female using fake [[pheromone]]s, attracting rival males which help raise its body temperature and thus its chance of breeding. [[Chalarodon|Malagasy collared lizard]]s conceal their eggs by burying them, but egg-eating [[Leioheterodon|hognose snake]]s stake out their favourite laying sites. [[Niue|Niue Island]] [[Laticauda|sea krait]]s lay theirs in a chamber only accessible via an underwater tunnel. Other reptiles guard their eggs. [[Horned lizard]]s drive off predators, but larger adversaries such as [[Masticophis flagellum|coachwhip]] snakes prompt a different reaction â€“ the lizard plays dead. Komodo dragons prey on [[water buffalo]] in the dry season. They stalk a buffalo for three weeks as it slowly succumbs to a toxic bite, then strip the carcass in four hours. In ''Life on Location'', the Komodo film crew tell of the harrowing experience of filming the dragon hunt.<ref name=bbc-episode-2>{{cite episode |title=Reptiles and Amphibians |series=Life |credits=Produced by Rupert Barrington |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-10-19|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nj6dr}}</ref>
