                       <p begin="0:00:27.040" end="0:00:30.880">The island of Komodo in Indonesia.</p>
                       <p begin="0:00:33.680" end="0:00:35.440">Remote and barren.</p>
                       <p begin="0:00:41.440" end="0:00:43.880">Few people live here.</p>
                       <p begin="0:00:47.680" end="0:00:51.000">It's ruled by a giant reptile.</p>
                       <p begin="0:00:54.800" end="0:00:58.640">It looks like a survivor from the age of the dinosaurs.</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:07.840" end="0:01:10.280">The Komodo dragon.</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:25.640" end="0:01:28.240">9 feet long.</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:28.280" end="0:01:30.040">A top predator.</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:34.880" end="0:01:40.920">Only one thing can challenge a dragon's dominance.</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:40.960" end="0:01:42.640">Another dragon.</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:47.240" end="0:01:52.440">In the breeding season, males are drawn into savage conflict.</p>
                       <p begin="0:02:01.520" end="0:02:07.680">Huge claws and 60 serrated teeth can inflict terrible damage.</p>
                       <p begin="0:02:41.360" end="0:02:47.200">The Komodo dragon is the only reptile that still rules the land...</p>
                       <p begin="0:02:47.240" end="0:02:49.360">as the dinosaurs once did.</p>
                       <p begin="0:02:52.800" end="0:02:56.160">It can dominate here because it has no competition.</p>
                       <p begin="0:02:59.360" end="0:03:02.880">But for the rest of the world's reptiles and amphibians,</p>
                       <p begin="0:03:02.920" end="0:03:05.320">survival is a much tougher struggle.</p>
                       <p begin="0:03:09.480" end="0:03:14.400">Like the dragon, reptiles and amphibians seem primitive,</p>
                       <p begin="0:03:14.440" end="0:03:17.200">better suited to an earlier age.</p>
                       <p begin="0:03:23.560" end="0:03:28.560">Yet they have a surprising repertoire of extraordinary strategies.</p>
                       <p begin="0:03:30.640" end="0:03:33.680">And they still thrive in many parts of the planet.</p>
                       <p begin="0:03:39.960" end="0:03:46.520">This is the story of how they do so.</p>
                       <p begin="0:03:59.760" end="0:04:05.880">South America, the remote jungle where Brazil and Venezuela meet.</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:08.320" end="0:04:11.880">Sheer-sided mountains rise up from the jungle.</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:27.400" end="0:04:31.280">Few places on Earth are wetter.</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:31.320" end="0:04:35.800">It's the home of some ancient and very peculiar amphibians.</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:37.800" end="0:04:43.440">The waterfall toad is just an inch long, the size of a postage stamp.</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:43.480" end="0:04:50.240">Its special gripping hands enable it to clamber safely, high in the tree tops.</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:59.520" end="0:05:02.280">But it's not alone up here.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:07.080" end="0:05:11.920">Most frogs and toads avoid predators by hopping out of danger.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:16.920" end="0:05:22.240">But this toad never evolved the ability to hop for more than an inch</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:22.280" end="0:05:24.920">and that's nowhere near enough.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:24.960" end="0:05:28.200">One way it gets eaten.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:28.240" end="0:05:31.720">The other way is thin air.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:31.760" end="0:05:33.400">Not much of a choice.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:47.200" end="0:05:50.760">But this isn't suicide.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:50.800" end="0:05:52.640">It's a deliberate strategy,</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:52.680" end="0:05:55.560">and one that depends on the size and strength</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:55.600" end="0:05:57.720">of those extraordinary hands.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:59.720" end="0:06:04.400">Free-falling like this is a very effective way of escaping.</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:10.320" end="0:06:16.440">However, another toad on this same mountain has elaborated this strategy.</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:21.800" end="0:06:25.720">It lives a mile above the forest, on this plateau,</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:25.760" end="0:06:28.120">cut off from the world below.</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:38.440" end="0:06:41.400">This is a pebble toad.</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:41.440" end="0:06:44.080">It too is only an inch long.</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:49.520" end="0:06:53.800">These rocks may seem a paradise for a toad.</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:53.840" end="0:06:57.600">It's even wetter than the forest below and there are no snakes.</p>
                       <p begin="0:07:02.560" end="0:07:05.360">But there is a hunter here.</p>
                       <p begin="0:07:23.200" end="0:07:26.920">A toad-eating tarantula.</p>
                       <p begin="0:07:32.960" end="0:07:35.840">It ambushes its prey.</p>
                       <p begin="0:07:42.880" end="0:07:47.120">Like the waterfall toad, the pebble toad can't hop.</p>
                       <p begin="0:07:47.160" end="0:07:49.680">But it has a different defence.</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:08.680" end="0:08:15.360">It tenses its muscles, becomes rigid and turns itself into a rubber ball.</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:21.200" end="0:08:24.920">It's so tiny and weighs so little</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:24.960" end="0:08:29.400">that bouncing doesn't hurt it at all.</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:42.720" end="0:08:46.840">Bizarre innovations like these are one of the reasons why</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:46.880" end="0:08:51.360">amphibians and reptiles are still so successful.</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:06.160" end="0:09:07.720">Some of them, however,</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:07.760" end="0:09:11.160">have hardly changed for tens of millions of years.</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:23.560" end="0:09:26.040">Brazil's Pantanal.</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:27.640" end="0:09:31.000">Over 50,000 square miles of swamp.</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:33.720" end="0:09:38.960">In the dry season, the water is reduced to isolated pools</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:39.000" end="0:09:44.600">and then they contain the greatest concentration of crocodiles on Earth.</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:46.880" end="0:09:49.800">These caiman crocodiles</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:49.840" end="0:09:53.360">are trapped and fast running out of food.</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:53.400" end="0:09:57.600">It will be a long time before the rains return and the rivers rise</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:57.640" end="0:10:00.560">bringing with them the caiman's prey...fish.</p>
                       <p begin="0:10:04.000" end="0:10:08.000">Being cold blooded they can go without food for months</p>
                       <p begin="0:10:08.040" end="0:10:11.400">and stay inactive except when they squabble.</p>
                       <p begin="0:10:49.760" end="0:10:54.760">At last, the rains return and rivers swell.</p>
                       <p begin="0:11:10.880" end="0:11:13.800">All reptiles are experts at saving energy.</p>
                       <p begin="0:11:13.840" end="0:11:19.400">The caiman simply line up and wait for the fish to come to them.</p>
                       <p begin="0:11:58.560" end="0:12:02.000">Reptiles and amphibians must warm their bodies</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:02.080" end="0:12:05.240">before they can become active and until then</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:05.280" end="0:12:08.000">they are slow-moving and vulnerable.</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:20.280" end="0:12:24.480">The quickest way to gain heat is to bask in the sun,</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:24.520" end="0:12:28.440">as this basilisk lizard from Central America is doing.</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:28.480" end="0:12:31.240">The trouble is that exposing yourself</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:31.280" end="0:12:33.800">inevitably makes you easily seen.</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:38.200" end="0:12:41.720">But a conspicuous perch over a river like this</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:41.760" end="0:12:46.000">seems to be making yourself unnecessarily prominent.</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:46.040" end="0:12:51.040">This basilisk's greatest threat comes from the sky.</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:51.080" end="0:12:53.960">Dark shapes overhead make it nervous.</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:56.600" end="0:13:01.240">A hunting bird might expect it to flee to the trees.</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:04.680" end="0:13:07.240">In fact, it does the opposite.</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:10.480" end="0:13:15.880">This skitter across the surface of the water earns it precious seconds</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:15.920" end="0:13:19.440">and the nickname, Jesus Christ lizard.</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:26.600" end="0:13:29.480">It drives its feet down so hard and so fast</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:29.520" end="0:13:32.680">that it never sinks deeper than a few inches.</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:34.600" end="0:13:39.160">A human would need to run at 65mph to do this.</p>
                       <p begin="0:14:23.000" end="0:14:26.560">Reptiles are certainly expert at avoiding trouble</p>
                       <p begin="0:14:26.600" end="0:14:30.800">but they are also very good at finding a way to live in places</p>
                       <p begin="0:14:30.840" end="0:14:33.440">that don't seem to suit them at all.</p>
                       <p begin="0:14:45.040" end="0:14:50.320">They once included the largest animals that have ever walked the Earth...</p>
                       <p begin="0:14:50.360" end="0:14:53.280">the dinosaurs.</p>
                       <p begin="0:14:53.320" end="0:14:57.400">And some living ones are a million times smaller than T Rex.</p>
                       <p begin="0:14:57.440" end="0:15:01.240">Smaller indeed, than some insects.</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:11.760" end="0:15:17.720">The Brazilian pygmy gecko could sit comfortably on a finger tip.</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:17.760" end="0:15:23.880">It's so exceptionally small that no other reptiles compete with it.</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:23.920" end="0:15:25.040">But it's so nimble</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:25.080" end="0:15:28.800">it can escape from the hunting monsters of the undergrowth.</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:40.400" end="0:15:46.960">It is so small that it has special problems with, for example, rain.</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:57.840" end="0:15:59.720">It could drown in a drop</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:59.760" end="0:16:02.600">but its skin is hydrophobic.</p>
                       <p begin="0:16:04.240" end="0:16:06.440">Rain cannot wet it.</p>
                       <p begin="0:16:09.360" end="0:16:13.400">A tumble into a puddle, you might think,</p>
                       <p begin="0:16:13.440" end="0:16:15.880">would risk death by drowning.</p>
                       <p begin="0:16:25.800" end="0:16:28.800">But the gecko is unsinkable.</p>
                       <p begin="0:16:32.760" end="0:16:36.600">It's so light and its skin sowater-repellent</p>
                       <p begin="0:16:36.640" end="0:16:39.760">that it canliterally stand on water.</p>
                       <p begin="0:16:47.160" end="0:16:51.280">Such miniaturisation is certainly very impressive</p>
                       <p begin="0:16:51.320" end="0:16:55.680">but the reptile body can be transformed even more dramatically.</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:02.760" end="0:17:06.440">One of the most bizarre of allreptiles</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:06.480" end="0:17:09.840">hunts insects herein Madagascar.</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:15.360" end="0:17:18.800">The praying mantis has 360 degree vision</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:18.840" end="0:17:23.520">but it hasn't seen the danger thatisnow approaching.</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:44.240" end="0:17:46.600">A panther chameleon.</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:46.640" end="0:17:48.240">Every part of its body</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:48.280" end="0:17:53.240">has become specialised for a life of stealth among the branches.</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:55.960" end="0:17:59.320">Its toes have become grasping pincers.</p>

                       <p begin="0:18:45.440" end="0:18:47.800">The tongue is a like a missile,</p>

                       <p begin="0:20:28.760" end="0:20:32.160">so she exploits the chameleon's versatile skin.</p>

                       <p begin="0:23:59.120" end="0:24:02.560">A male red-sided garter snake.</p>
                       <p begin="0:24:02.600" end="0:24:05.640">He survived the winter by hibernating underground</p>

                       <p begin="0:24:18.800" end="0:24:25.000">They are cold and can't move fast, yet they are in an urgent race.</p>
                       <p begin="0:24:25.040" end="0:24:28.680">The first males to warm up will have a head start,</p>

                       <p begin="0:25:08.760" end="0:25:12.040">At last, a female has emerged.</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:12.080" end="0:25:17.400">The warmest males will inevitably be the first to react to her smell.</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:17.440" end="0:25:21.600">She will only mate once, so competition between them is intense.</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:39.320" end="0:25:42.320">This male has overslept.</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:46.040" end="0:25:48.680">He will need hours to warm up.</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:48.720" end="0:25:52.880">At the moment he stands no chance of mating.</p>
                       <p begin="0:26:04.920" end="0:26:10.320">Most of the other males are ready to chase females but, curiously,</p>
                       <p begin="0:26:10.360" end="0:26:14.320">some leave the race and go to join the cold male.</p>
                       <p begin="0:26:20.560" end="0:26:23.160">They slide their warm bodies over him,</p>
                       <p begin="0:26:23.200" end="0:26:26.480">just as they would if they were courting a female.</p>

                       <p begin="0:26:48.760" end="0:26:51.440">His cool body, showing as blue,</p>
                       <p begin="0:26:51.480" end="0:26:56.600">is quickly warming as it absorbs heat from the other males.</p>
                       <p begin="0:26:56.640" end="0:27:00.360">He's a trickster, he's fooled the others by giving off a scent</p>
                       <p begin="0:27:00.400" end="0:27:04.040">just like a female's and they are trying to mate with him.</p>
                       <p begin="0:27:06.280" end="0:27:10.960">He only needs a few minutes of this to steal enough heat from his rivals</p>
                       <p begin="0:27:11.000" end="0:27:13.080">to catch up and join the chase.</p>

                       <p begin="0:27:28.000" end="0:27:32.760">It is, in numbers, the greatest gathering of reptiles in the world.</p>

                       <p begin="0:28:23.480" end="0:28:26.360">She appears to have the answer.</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:48.440" end="0:28:53.080">She covers all traces of where she buried them.</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:53.120" end="0:28:54.720">It's a good strategy.</p>

                       <p begin="0:35:39.840" end="0:35:42.880">The eggs will be completely safe here</p>
                       <p begin="0:35:42.920" end="0:35:45.560">and she can return to the open sea.</p>

                       <p begin="0:39:08.240" end="0:39:11.240">The females laid their eggs in the shallows</p>

                       <p begin="0:39:20.720" end="0:39:24.000">and the shallows have shrunk to a single pool.</p>

                       <p begin="0:41:33.080" end="0:41:38.680">But in hard times the dragons risk hunting something much bigger.</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:40.720" end="0:41:44.720">Water buffalo, an animal ten times their size.</p>

                       <p begin="0:42:00.720" end="0:42:02.680">It's the dry season.</p>

                       <p begin="0:42:11.440" end="0:42:14.880">Dragons lurk around the margins.</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:14.920" end="0:42:19.960">The buffalo seems to view them as just an irritation,</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:20.000" end="0:42:21.480">not a danger.</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:23.840" end="0:42:25.320">A serious mistake.</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:36.480" end="0:42:41.280">The dragon is wary a jab or a kick could injure it fatally.</p>
                       <p begin="0:43:11.560" end="0:43:16.920">The bites are just flesh wounds but other dragons are alert now.</p>
                       <p begin="0:43:16.960" end="0:43:20.400">Like sharks, they're excited by blood.</p>

                       <p begin="0:43:37.680" end="0:43:41.040">The dragons appear to have failed.</p>
                       <p begin="0:43:47.800" end="0:43:51.760">Yet they show a peculiar interest in the buffalo</p>
                       <p begin="0:43:51.800" end="0:43:54.400">and follow it wherever it goes.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:04.360" end="0:44:09.440">As the days pass, the buffalo's wounds don't heal.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:09.480" end="0:44:11.320">It starts to weaken.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:11.360" end="0:44:16.720">The dragons' hunting method begins to come clear.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:16.760" end="0:44:22.960">A brand new discovery reveals that the dragon has venom, like a snake.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:23.000" end="0:44:25.680">The bite will eventually prove fatal</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:25.720" end="0:44:28.600">but it's going to take several weeks.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:38.360" end="0:44:43.480">The dragons, however, can afford to wait for a meal of this size.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:45.040" end="0:44:49.800">They simply stick close to their victim and conserve their energy.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:52.120" end="0:44:56.280">Thousands of years ago, dwarf elephants lived here.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:56.320" end="0:45:00.560">The dragons probably hunted them in exactly the same way.</p>
                       <p begin="0:45:02.520" end="0:45:06.440">But the process is a long, drawn out one.</p>
                       <p begin="0:45:06.480" end="0:45:09.920">Three weeks later and the buffalo is very weak.</p>
                       <p begin="0:45:37.880" end="0:45:41.200">The dragonssense that the end is near.</p>
                       <p begin="0:45:45.880" end="0:45:49.640">They must remain wary, the buffalo could still lash out.</p>
                       <p begin="0:45:58.320" end="0:46:02.760">Gradually they closein to try and finish it off.</p>
                       <p begin="0:46:34.880" end="0:46:38.360">The dragons'strategy is certainly merciless</p>
                       <p begin="0:46:38.400" end="0:46:42.280">but it is the only way that they can get a meal like this</p>
                       <p begin="0:46:42.320" end="0:46:46.200">and in hard timesthey need it if they're to survive.</p>
                       <p begin="0:47:01.920" end="0:47:05.080">The buffalo died in the night.</p>
                       <p begin="0:47:10.560" end="0:47:14.000">Tenbig dragons have gathered to feed.</p>
                       <p begin="0:47:18.840" end="0:47:24.560">They strip the buffalo to the bone in just four hours.</p>
                       <p begin="0:47:32.480" end="0:47:36.400">This is the biggest venomous animal on the planet.</p>

                       <p begin="0:48:36.880" end="0:48:41.120">So cameraman Kevin Flay and researcher Matt Swarbrick</p>
                       <p begin="0:48:41.160" end="0:48:43.320">didn't know what to expect.</p>
                       <p begin="0:48:43.360" end="0:48:46.080">They thought it would be a physicalchallenge</p>
                       <p begin="0:48:46.120" end="0:48:49.520">but they hadn't bargained for emotional turmoil as well.</p>
                       <p begin="0:48:59.240" end="0:49:02.240">They reached Komodo after a four day journey.</p>

                       <p begin="0:49:04.560" end="0:49:06.680">knows they're in dragon territory.</p>

                       <p begin="0:49:11.000" end="0:49:15.760">Their only protection is these rangers, armed with sticks.</p>
                       <p begin="0:49:24.640" end="0:49:27.280">These big ones look really scary, actually.</p>
                       <p begin="0:49:27.320" end="0:49:30.320">And not until you get, till they come really in close</p>
                       <p begin="0:49:30.360" end="0:49:34.320">and when they're by the camera, then you tend to question your faith</p>

                       <p begin="0:49:47.560" end="0:49:50.560">But this dragon isn't a big one.</p>
                       <p begin="0:49:50.600" end="0:49:55.400">At five foot, this dragon is just over half grown.</p>
                       <p begin="0:49:55.440" end="0:49:57.960">The really big ones live in land,</p>

                       <p begin="0:50:09.720" end="0:50:13.720">We could spend five weeks walking around all over the island</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:13.760" end="0:50:17.760">just trying to find dragons randomly coming across buffalos</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:17.800" end="0:50:20.640">but fortunately for us it is the dry season</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:20.680" end="0:50:24.440">and there's only one decent waterhole left on the island</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:24.480" end="0:50:28.760">and both the dragons and the buffalo require water, obviously,</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:28.800" end="0:50:30.680">which brings them together.</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:30.720" end="0:50:32.600">Kevin decides to wait here,</p>

                       <p begin="0:50:35.720" end="0:50:38.080">it looks like the wrong decision.</p>

                       <p begin="0:50:44.400" end="0:50:45.880">Look.</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:49.520" end="0:50:52.360">See that.</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:52.400" end="0:50:54.040">Hello, mate.</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:54.080" end="0:50:57.520">After almost a week something changes</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:57.560" end="0:51:00.360">and a couple of dragons appear.</p>

                       <p begin="0:51:14.600" end="0:51:17.080">Always know how dangerous a situation is,</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:17.120" end="0:51:19.160">but it does seem a bit concerning</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:19.200" end="0:51:21.760">that one of our rangers is sat up in a tree.</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:28.160" end="0:51:32.480">But the dragons show no interest in the buffalo or the crew</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:32.520" end="0:51:35.000">and the frustration continues.</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:35.040" end="0:51:37.960">Yet their task seems so simple.</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:38.000" end="0:51:40.040">So all we need</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:40.080" end="0:51:45.760">isfor him to film him attacking him.</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:48.440" end="0:51:52.920">But it looks like he isabout to attack him.</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:58.080" end="0:52:02.080">Just cut myself, that's not good in dragon country.</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:02.120" end="0:52:03.920">I better be careful.</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:03.960" end="0:52:07.520">Now we've gotta start our walk home, it takes just over an hour</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:07.560" end="0:52:10.600">but the thing is, if stuff's happenedand you've got,</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:10.640" end="0:52:13.720">you've managed to film good stuff then it, it's really easy,</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:13.760" end="0:52:15.880">you just trot on home andfind some dinner</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:15.920" end="0:52:18.440">and find out what the rats have done to your room.</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:18.480" end="0:52:20.760">But it's still really hot at this time of day</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:20.800" end="0:52:22.440">and so, if you've not filmed a lot</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:22.480" end="0:52:24.360">and you've just sat here all day long,</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:24.400" end="0:52:26.280">thenit's a hell of a long walk home.</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:26.320" end="0:52:31.680">They have a lot of long walks home but finally a new dragon appears,</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:31.720" end="0:52:35.880">something about its attitude seems different.</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:35.920" end="0:52:40.440">Maybe we could be onto something but I've now lost that other dragon,</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:40.480" end="0:52:42.400">which makes me a bit nervous.</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:46.800" end="0:52:49.160">At first it's wary,</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:49.200" end="0:52:52.280">unwilling to get too close to the buffalo.</p>
                       <p begin="0:53:02.680" end="0:53:04.920">Big dragons involved here.</p>
                       <p begin="0:53:09.960" end="0:53:13.040">That came from absolutely nowhere.</p>
                       <p begin="0:53:13.080" end="0:53:18.200">That guy has got some real attitude.</p>
                       <p begin="0:53:36.800" end="0:53:42.040">That first bite and the smell of blood set off a chain reaction.</p>
                       <p begin="0:53:42.080" end="0:53:44.800">All the dragons seem to come to life.</p>
                       <p begin="0:53:50.600" end="0:53:54.920">The peaceful watering hole is now a dangerous place to be.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:02.480" end="0:54:05.240">Well, I've definitely got two heads at the moment,</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:05.280" end="0:54:07.760">one as a cameraman saying, "Yes, brilliant!"</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:07.800" end="0:54:10.960">And the other one's thinking, "That poor animal," you know,</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:11.000" end="0:54:13.280">"That's not nice, that's really not nice."</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:21.560" end="0:54:23.040">Quickly, quick,</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:23.080" end="0:54:25.760">quick, quick.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:38.720" end="0:54:42.000">My heart's pumping a bit.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:42.040" end="0:54:46.400">At least my heart still works. Good Lord, that was a bit hairy.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:48.240" end="0:54:51.560">Now the crew must follow the buffalo everyday</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:51.600" end="0:54:53.760">to finish their filming job.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:53.800" end="0:54:58.000">This begins to take a toll on their emotions.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:58.040" end="0:55:01.760">He knows he's injured, he can't walk properly</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:01.800" end="0:55:06.000">and he's got these predators just gathering around him,</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:06.040" end="0:55:08.360">waiting for the opportunity.</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:08.400" end="0:55:09.680">It's gruesome.</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:09.720" end="0:55:14.720">Shadowing the buffalo means staying close to the dragons too.</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:14.760" end="0:55:18.880">This is mad we've, just, just followed a, the buffalo</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:18.920" end="0:55:22.400">and, I think, six dragons, I've lost track now,</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:22.440" end="0:55:26.040">I think it's six dragons, down into the riverbed</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:26.080" end="0:55:29.200">and, you know, it's, they're stalking it,</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:29.240" end="0:55:31.000">we're all a bit nervous,</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:31.040" end="0:55:34.840">this is actually quite frightening, I have to say.</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:42.240" end="0:55:45.800">They're so capable and so unafraid of us</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:45.840" end="0:55:49.160">and they would have no problems at all</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:49.200" end="0:55:52.280">of causing us major, major damage.</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:53.840" end="0:55:59.360">At the moment I feel about 5 to 10% confident that I'm safe here</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:59.400" end="0:56:02.600">but the truth is we just don't know.</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:12.560" end="0:56:14.240">As the days pass,Kevin and Matt</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:14.280" end="0:56:18.080">can't help butfeel more deeply involved.</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:20.200" end="0:56:23.000">I'm sure they're starting tothink of us as death,</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:23.040" end="0:56:24.360">you know, the camera team.</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:24.400" end="0:56:27.400">Because, although we, you know, we're not influencing it</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:27.440" end="0:56:30.600">in anyway, really, we're always therewhen the dragon's there</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:30.640" end="0:56:33.600">and, you know,she's sick so we're following her</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:33.640" end="0:56:35.760">and you see her looking backat you</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:35.800" end="0:56:39.760">and I'm sure I feel like death and his scythe's comingin to kill.</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:39.800" end="0:56:44.120">I'm not really that sure how cut out I am for this.</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:44.160" end="0:56:49.120">If, if the game is spendingall your time watching an animaldie...</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:49.160" end="0:56:50.920">I don't know about that.</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:54.680" end="0:56:57.160">The dragons seem brutal,</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:57.200" end="0:57:00.480">yet this is the only way they can get large prey.</p>
                       <p begin="0:57:06.960" end="0:57:10.720">For the team, the event has become personal.</p>
                       <p begin="0:57:12.960" end="0:57:15.680">I think as we've got to know himand, you know,</p>
                       <p begin="0:57:15.720" end="0:57:19.360">we've seen him everymorning, we've seen him everyevening</p>
                       <p begin="0:57:19.400" end="0:57:22.440">and, you know, you build up arelationship with him</p>
                       <p begin="0:57:22.480" end="0:57:25.120">and, and todayI think he, he kind of gave up.</p>
                       <p begin="0:57:31.120" end="0:57:33.960">The next dayit isall over.</p>
                       <p begin="0:57:42.200" end="0:57:46.120">Now it's over, you sit back and reflect and you sort of feel,</p>
                       <p begin="0:57:46.160" end="0:57:47.640">that was just astonishing.</p>
                       <p begin="0:57:50.680" end="0:57:53.120">And it feels so primeval.</p>
                       <p begin="0:57:53.160" end="0:57:56.760">It feels we're watching something from a different era.</p>
                       <p begin="0:57:56.800" end="0:58:00.840">And they really are the most fantastic things to be with.</p>
                       <p begin="0:58:00.880" end="0:58:02.440">Scary....</p>
                       <p begin="0:58:02.480" end="0:58:04.600">awesome, you know, to look at</p>
                       <p begin="0:58:04.640" end="0:58:09.440">you just feel that you are looking at something from Jurassic Park.</p>
