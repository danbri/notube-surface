    <div>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:24.84" id="p0" end="00:00:27.00">One 150 million years ago,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:27.00" id="p1" end="00:00:30.60">as dinosaurs approached<br />their golden age,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:30.60" id="p2" end="00:00:35.08">one group evolved along<br />new and revolutionary lines.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:49.40" id="p3" end="00:00:53.60">Although they retained many of<br />their reptilian characteristics,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:53.60" id="p4" end="00:00:56.56">they acquired extraordinary<br />new ones...</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:59.24" id="p5" end="00:01:00.32">..feathers.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:11.36" id="p6" end="00:01:15.56">Feathers helped with insulation</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:15.56" id="p7" end="00:01:17.20">and display.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:18.72" id="p8" end="00:01:21.68">But they offered something<br />far more valuable.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:25.04" id="p9" end="00:01:27.12">The power of flight.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:32.20" id="p10" end="00:01:36.56">And for birds,<br />that changed everything.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:40.92" id="p11" end="00:01:48.08">Birds have the freedom of the skies,<br />to travel further and faster<br />than any other group of animals</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:48.08" id="p12" end="00:01:51.92">and to seize opportunities<br />in all corners of the planet.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:54.48" id="p13" end="00:01:58.44">But this freedom<br />brings many survival challenges,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:58.44" id="p14" end="00:02:02.32">which birds must tackle<br />at pivotal moments in their lives.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:28.68" id="p15" end="00:02:32.96">Flying demands enormous skill<br />and effort,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:32.96" id="p16" end="00:02:38.88">and nowhere is that more evident<br />than here, in the foothills<br />of the Peruvian Andes.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:42.84" id="p17" end="00:02:48.80">This female hummingbird hovers with<br />precision in her quest for nectar.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:51.04" id="p18" end="00:02:56.12">Her wing and tail design<br />allow her to fly in any direction.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:02.32" id="p19" end="00:03:06.20">But the male<br />has a real problem flying.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:08.40" id="p20" end="00:03:10.92">And this is why</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:10.92" id="p21" end="00:03:17.36">he's weighed down with two<br />super-long tail feathers,<br />tipped with cumbersome discs.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:22.20" id="p22" end="00:03:25.80">This is the marvellous<br />spatuletail hummingbird.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:25.80" id="p23" end="00:03:29.52">and these are his flags<br />with which to seduce a mate.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:33.72" id="p24" end="00:03:37.00">Waving them back and forth<br />takes a lot of effort,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:37.00" id="p25" end="00:03:39.32">even from the comfort of his perch,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:39.32" id="p26" end="00:03:42.20">but to win her heart<br />he's got to go up a gear.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:07.52" id="p27" end="00:04:13.64">He must show her how well he can fly<br />but it's exhausting work.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:21.76" id="p28" end="00:04:27.00">It's so demanding he can only stay<br />airborne for a matter of seconds</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:27.00" id="p29" end="00:04:28.88">before he needs a rest.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:35.28" id="p30" end="00:04:39.80">He's struggling to impress her,<br />so one last try.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:46.96" id="p31" end="00:04:54.56">The extreme effort and energy needed<br />to hover means hummingbirds can<br />only fly in short, sharp bursts.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:59.40" id="p32" end="00:05:04.12">But most birds need to stay<br />airborne for considerably longer,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:04.12" id="p33" end="00:05:08.24">and must find far more<br />energy-efficient ways to get around.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:17.84" id="p34" end="00:05:21.20">Here in the Simien mountains<br />of Ethiopia,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:21.20" id="p35" end="00:05:25.40">at a breathtaking altitude<br />of 15,000 feet,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:25.40" id="p36" end="00:05:28.00">lives a supreme aerial maestro.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:33.76" id="p37" end="00:05:35.52">The lammergeier.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:39.76" id="p38" end="00:05:45.88">This youngster<br />glides on air currents rising from<br />the mountain slopes below.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:50.48" id="p39" end="00:05:54.24">His nine-foot wingspan can<br />carry him hundreds of miles a day</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:54.24" id="p40" end="00:05:59.20">in search of animal carcasses,<br />with precious little effort.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:02.60" id="p41" end="00:06:08.00">He watches out for other<br />airborne scavengers,<br />like these griffon vultures.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:13.16" id="p42" end="00:06:18.32">They lead him to some<br />commotion on the cliffs,<br />and maybe the chance to feed.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:20.44" id="p43" end="00:06:25.00">But this youngster is not the only<br />lammergeier to spot the opportunity.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:26.52" id="p44" end="00:06:29.04">So too has this adult.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:43.40" id="p45" end="00:06:46.24">The vultures quickly strip<br />the carcass clean.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:53.80" id="p46" end="00:06:59.76">It seems he's too late. But in fact<br />he's timed his arrival perfectly.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:17.24" id="p47" end="00:07:19.48">There's no meat left</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:19.48" id="p48" end="00:07:25.36">and that's exactly the moment<br />that the lammergeier<br />has been waiting for.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:25.36" id="p49" end="00:07:27.68">It's bones he's after.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:34.84" id="p50" end="00:07:38.68">The young lammergeier too<br />homes in on the carcass.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:57.36" id="p51" end="00:08:01.40">Bones contain rich marrow fat,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:01.40" id="p52" end="00:08:03.76">but extracting it is not easy,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:03.76" id="p53" end="00:08:09.28">especially when the bone is a solid<br />four kilos and too big to swallow.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:09.28" id="p54" end="00:08:14.60">But lammergeiers<br />have an extraordinary solution,<br />thanks to their flying skills.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:23.84" id="p55" end="00:08:28.40">Soaring up on thermal air currents<br />and positioning the bone parallel</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:28.40" id="p56" end="00:08:34.04">to his body to minimize drag,<br />he soon reaches the perfect height.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:39.36" id="p57" end="00:08:42.60">From here<br />he glides to a place he knows</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:42.60" id="p58" end="00:08:44.20">where he can deal with the bone,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:44.20" id="p59" end="00:08:47.48">where there are giant rock slabs<br />sit on the lip of an escarpment.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:07.80" id="p60" end="00:09:09.92">The bone is smashed.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:20.68" id="p61" end="00:09:25.24">The juices in his stomach are<br />more corrosive than battery acid.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:25.24" id="p62" end="00:09:29.56">They dissolve the bone so that<br />he can now digest the marrow.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:34.72" id="p63" end="00:09:40.16">Others come looking for leftovers.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:40.16" id="p64" end="00:09:42.36">But their timing isn't ideal</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:42.36" id="p65" end="00:09:46.20">because now the young<br />lammergeier has his turn!</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:56.24" id="p66" end="00:09:58.64">They'd better mind their heads!</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:16.28" id="p67" end="00:10:19.68">Proficient bone smashing<br />takes endless practice</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:19.68" id="p68" end="00:10:24.16">to find just the right height,<br />speed and moment of release.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:45.08" id="p69" end="00:10:48.12">Lammergeiers have long, broad wings,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:48.12" id="p70" end="00:10:53.16">ideal for gliding great distances<br />with maximum efficiency.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:57.52" id="p71" end="00:11:01.12">But on the island of<br />Little Tobago in the Caribbean</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:01.12" id="p72" end="00:11:05.68">lives a bird for whom aerial agility<br />is of paramount importance.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:08.84" id="p73" end="00:11:12.28">The red-billed tropicbird.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:15.24" id="p74" end="00:11:20.20">Short, pointed wings give it<br />great manoeuvrability and speed.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:25.44" id="p75" end="00:11:31.20">During the breeding season,<br />these flying skills are tested<br />to the limit.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:39.40" id="p76" end="00:11:43.84">While one parent looks after<br />the chick, the other must journey</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:43.84" id="p77" end="00:11:48.88">far offshore, to gather small fish<br />and squid from the surface waters.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:00.84" id="p78" end="00:12:08.44">But the hardest part is getting food<br />back to the island, because they<br />share this airspace with thieves.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:14.48" id="p79" end="00:12:17.20">Magnificent frigatebirds,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:17.20" id="p80" end="00:12:20.16">known as Man O' War birds,<br />patrol high above.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:54.12" id="p81" end="00:12:57.36">These pirates are<br />not trying to kill the tropicbird,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:57.36" id="p82" end="00:12:59.40">but force it to give up its catch.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:01.60" id="p83" end="00:13:03.84">It's an aerial dogfight.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:07.28" id="p84" end="00:13:09.40">Tropicbirds are quicker<br />on the turn.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:11.52" id="p85" end="00:13:14.80">Frigates have exceptionally<br />lightweight bodies</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:14.80" id="p86" end="00:13:18.00">and their extremely long<br />wings give them great power.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:30.28" id="p87" end="00:13:31.96">Success.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:44.00" id="p88" end="00:13:47.96">A favourite attack is from behind,<br />and at height.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:00.96" id="p89" end="00:14:03.52">There goes the fish -</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:03.52" id="p90" end="00:14:05.20">another victory.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:10.32" id="p91" end="00:14:15.12">This tropicbird chick still<br />awaits the return of its parent</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:15.12" id="p92" end="00:14:18.24">who has yet to run the<br />gauntlet of the pirates.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:23.36" id="p93" end="00:14:26.96">Keeping close to the<br />waves is his best chance.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:26.96" id="p94" end="00:14:29.84">Frigatebirds have so little<br />oil in their feathers</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:29.84" id="p95" end="00:14:31.40">they can't risk ditching.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:46.28" id="p96" end="00:14:50.60">If he can just reach the cliffs<br />he'll be safe.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:13.64" id="p97" end="00:15:18.12">He's made it,<br />with his crop still full of fish.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:49.16" id="p98" end="00:15:56.72">Red-billed tropicbirds rely on<br />extreme aerial agility to overcome<br />the many challenges of their life.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:59.96" id="p99" end="00:16:03.92">For others,<br />survival demands endurance.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:05.96" id="p100" end="00:16:08.56">Every spring, red knots</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:08.56" id="p101" end="00:16:16.24">fly 10,000 miles from their<br />wintering grounds in Argentina<br />to their nesting sites in Canada.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:17.96" id="p102" end="00:16:21.56">The only way they complete this<br />marathon journey</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:21.56" id="p103" end="00:16:27.48">is by making a crucial fuel stop<br />here in Delaware Bay,<br />on the east coast of America.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:30.72" id="p104" end="00:16:34.88">What is most extraordinary is that<br />as well as having to find their way</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:34.88" id="p105" end="00:16:40.00">to this one location, they must also<br />time their arrival to perfection.</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:17:05.80" id="p108" end="00:17:11.36">They come ashore in greatest numbers<br />on the highest spring tides.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:17:20.04" id="p109" end="00:17:22.24">Horseshoe crabs.</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:18:03.84" id="p111" end="00:18:05.80">That's what the knots are after.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:18:15.92" id="p112" end="00:18:18.52">Most eggs are buried out of reach,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:18:18.52" id="p113" end="00:18:22.36">but some are accidentally dug up<br />by other crabs.</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:18:54.64" id="p117" end="00:18:59.12">To achieve this, each knot<br />must eat as many as 400,000 eggs -</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:18:59.12" id="p118" end="00:19:04.32">a tall order given the skill and<br />effort needed to swallow just one.</p>

      <p begin="00:50:21.04" id="p301" end="00:50:22.60">Completely shattered.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:50:22.60" id="p302" end="00:50:25.76">The hard work had only just begun.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:50:27.52" id="p303" end="00:50:34.36">Tomorrow with the help of their<br />guides, the crew would go looking<br />for the best bowers to film</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:50:34.36" id="p304" end="00:50:37.84">but not before a cautionary<br />tale from the local chief.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:37.84" id="p305" end="00:50:39.88">HE SPEAKS IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:50:42.00" id="p306" end="00:50:45.20">So when he first was shown the bower<br />by his father</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:50:45.20" id="p307" end="00:50:47.16">he, there were flowers there,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:50:47.16" id="p308" end="00:50:51.36">and, as a 12-year-old child<br />he wanted to grab them</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:50:51.36" id="p309" end="00:50:53.32">but his father<br />immediately stopped him</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:50:53.32" id="p310" end="00:50:57.52">and said, that he<br />could not touch anything or take<br />anything away from the bower</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:50:57.52" id="p311" end="00:51:00.52">because otherwise it<br />would start raining very heavily.</p>

      <p begin="00:51:02.24" id="p313" end="00:51:03.96">Oh! <span tts:color="cyan">It's ten to five, Barrie.</span></p>
      <p begin="00:51:03.96" id="p314" end="00:51:05.60">Yep.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:51:05.60" id="p315" end="00:51:08.40">With the chief's warning fresh<br />in their minds,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:51:08.40" id="p316" end="00:51:12.00">Barrie and the team make an early<br />start and head for the hide.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:14.12" id="p317" end="00:51:21.40">Well, we've reached the hide<br />just at sunrise, so we're just gonna<br />get set up as quickly as we can.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:51:21.40" id="p318" end="00:51:26.80">With knowledgeable guides, finding<br />the bowers wasn't the problem.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:51:26.80" id="p319" end="00:51:29.80">And who could miss<br />such obvious structures?</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:51:33.68" id="p320" end="00:51:36.52">It was now a waiting game<br />for Barrie,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:51:36.52" id="p321" end="00:51:40.16">heavily concealed in his<br />camouflaged hide.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:40.16" id="p322" end="00:51:43.08">OK, it's 6.30,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:43.08" id="p323" end="00:51:48.08">so I'm just waiting now<br />for the bird to come, hoping that</p>
      <p begin="00:51:48.08" id="p324" end="00:51:50.60">he doesn't suspect that<br />anything is here</p>
      <p begin="00:51:50.60" id="p325" end="00:51:53.28">and that we can get<br />some natural behaviour.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:15.40" id="p326" end="00:52:16.44">BIRD CALLS</p>
      <p begin="00:52:16.44" id="p327" end="00:52:20.24">I've just heard the bowerbird call<br />just to the right of the hide.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:22.52" id="p328" end="00:52:23.64">RUSTLING</p>
      <p begin="00:52:23.64" id="p329" end="00:52:28.40">I can hear the bird outside, it's<br />plucking on the fabric of the hide.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:30.08" id="p330" end="00:52:35.60">I've just noticed that the bird has<br />pulled a Snickers wrapper out</p>
      <p begin="00:52:35.60" id="p331" end="00:52:39.80">of the bottom of the hide<br />and has added it to its display.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:43.96" id="p332" end="00:52:46.60">It was a very strange decoration</p>
      <p begin="00:52:46.60" id="p333" end="00:52:50.08">which I had to remove at<br />the end of the day.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:50.08" id="p334" end="00:52:52.12">THUNDER</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:52:59.64" id="p335" end="00:53:06.56">Had Barrie tempted fate<br />by removing the wrapper<br />and ignoring the chief's warning?</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:08.72" id="p336" end="00:53:13.88">Or was this just rainforest<br />living up to its name?</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:15.40" id="p337" end="00:53:19.96">When it pours like this, filming<br />becomes virtually impossible.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:27.80" id="p338" end="00:53:32.96">Soon the weather improved and Barrie<br />returned once more to the hide.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:41.88" id="p339" end="00:53:46.20">This time his lunch box<br />was firmly sealed.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:47.72" id="p340" end="00:53:52.20">The bird is very keen on these<br />little tiny metallic ladybirds</p>
      <p begin="00:53:52.20" id="p341" end="00:53:55.48">and they're a bit put out<br />being put there in this bower,</p>
      <p begin="00:53:55.48" id="p342" end="00:53:59.44">so, they start crawling off,<br />they're very slowly making their way</p>
      <p begin="00:53:59.44" id="p343" end="00:54:02.96">over the moss and they just about<br />get to the edge of display</p>
      <p begin="00:54:02.96" id="p344" end="00:54:08.08">and then the bowerbird notices<br />and goes and collects them and puts<br />them back again,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:08.36" id="p345" end="00:54:12.44">so they're kind of in this<br />endless cycle of trying to escape<br />from the bower,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:12.44" id="p346" end="00:54:14.92">they're just, they can<br />never quite get away.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:16.44" id="p347" end="00:54:22.08">However for the male bowerbird<br />and Barrie the female was<br />still proving a problem.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:22.08" id="p348" end="00:54:25.84">The female did come down,<br />but she was quite nervous</p>
      <p begin="00:54:25.84" id="p349" end="00:54:30.84">near the entrance to the bower,<br />so we didn't get very much of that.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:30.84" id="p350" end="00:54:32.64">This was a real concern,</p>
      <p begin="00:54:32.64" id="p351" end="00:54:36.88">because the courtship behaviour<br />was key to our story.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:38.48" id="p352" end="00:54:40.60">He's just done a 10-hour stint,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:40.60" id="p353" end="00:54:44.60">been a really nice day so we're<br />just hoping it's gone well.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:46.20" id="p354" end="00:54:52.00">Another day's filming over,<br />and still little to show for it.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:52.00" id="p355" end="00:54:54.40">10 hours in the hide.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:54.40" id="p356" end="00:54:56.68">Fortunately filming<br />is over for the day,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:56.68" id="p357" end="00:54:59.32">we're just gonna<br />go and collect Barrie again.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:59.32" id="p358" end="00:55:01.28">Did you see a mate today?</p>
      <p begin="00:55:01.28" id="p359" end="00:55:03.72">No, no, mating.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:03.72" id="p360" end="00:55:06.68">Everything else is going well<br />but we haven't got the mating.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:08.64" id="p361" end="00:55:14.48">The fact I was getting such good<br />footage of the male meant he'd<br />obviously got used to the hide.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:16.00" id="p362" end="00:55:19.24">But the visiting females<br />were still wary of it.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:19.24" id="p363" end="00:55:25.44">The females did seem a bit nervous,<br />so I took the decision to<br />push the hide back,</p>
      <p begin="00:55:25.44" id="p364" end="00:55:32.12">just to get more distance<br />from the birds, the other thing<br />I've done is recessed the lens</p>
      <p begin="00:55:32.12" id="p365" end="00:55:38.32">and we put this vegetation all around<br />it, so I'm hoping that's gonna<br />provide more female behaviour.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:40.60" id="p366" end="00:55:45.88">There were few filming days left,<br />it was crucial Barrie's<br />adjustments paid off.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:50.00" id="p367" end="00:55:53.52">The male has just run into the bower<br />and started calling</p>
      <p begin="00:55:53.52" id="p368" end="00:55:56.84">so I think that means<br />there might be a female coming.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:06.24" id="p369" end="00:56:09.80">It struck me, here we both<br />were waiting in the darkness,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:09.80" id="p370" end="00:56:12.32">the male trying<br />to attract the female,</p>
      <p begin="00:56:12.32" id="p371" end="00:56:18.56">and I was just hoping that<br />I'd got it right this time and it<br />was more than just a fleeting visit.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:27.16" id="p372" end="00:56:30.72">Working in a hide involves hours<br />of prolonged inactivity</p>
      <p begin="00:56:30.72" id="p373" end="00:56:33.88">punctuated by the most<br />intense moments of action.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:39.96" id="p374" end="00:56:44.08">This was the crucial moment<br />the whole team had worked towards.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:56:50.36" id="p375" end="00:56:53.32">Everything was falling<br />into place for Barrie,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:56:53.32" id="p376" end="00:56:56.00">the behaviour unfolding.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:56.00" id="p377" end="00:56:58.32">Right, that's good,<br />think we're in action.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:57:01.48" id="p378" end="00:57:05.36">21 days in a hide,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:57:05.36" id="p379" end="00:57:08.52">astonishing patience<br />and perseverance.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:57:14.96" id="p380" end="00:57:17.88">This has never been filmed before.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:57:23.04" id="p381" end="00:57:29.36">Such effort and endeavour for<br />a crucial piece of behaviour<br />that's over in a matter of seconds.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:30.36" id="p382" end="00:57:32.64">Would you like to<br />shake my hand, Stephen?</p>
      <p begin="00:57:32.64" id="p383" end="00:57:35.16"><span tts:color="cyan">What does that mean?<br /></span>Well, we got the mating.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:35.16" id="p384" end="00:57:37.84"><span tts:color="cyan">You got the mating?<br /></span>Yeah, yeah, we got the mating.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:37.84" id="p385" end="00:57:42.24"><span tts:color="cyan">Oh, wow.<br /></span>Yeah, so really good day, brilliant<br />day, yeah but just, just amazing.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:42.24" id="p386" end="00:57:47.56">I must have - well, what is it -<br />three weeks I've spent sitting in<br />this hide, and I just didn't think</p>
      <p begin="00:57:47.56" id="p387" end="00:57:54.40">we'd ever get it, cos we're<br />running out of days, only a few left<br />now, so, so to get that this week is,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:54.40" id="p388" end="00:57:59.72">is just incredible and it was<br />a really, really good, really good<br />behaviour, so I'm delighted.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:58:01.24" id="p389" end="00:58:07.40">Success! This was Barrie's last<br />filming trip for the Birds episode</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:58:07.40" id="p390" end="00:58:09.80">and what a befitting end.</p>
