[[Bird]]s, whose [[feather]]s have made them extremely adaptable and enabled them to fly, are the subject of programme five. The courtship flight of the [[Marvellous Spatuletail|marvellous spatuletail hummingbird]] is shot at high speed to slow down its rapid wing beats. The male must rest every few seconds due to the energy needed to display his elongated tail feathers. [[bearded vulture|Lammergeier]]s, by contrast, soar on mountain thermals with a minimum of effort. A [[red-billed tropicbird]] bringing a meal back to its chick uses aerial agility to evade the marauding [[magnificent frigatebird]]s. Some birds nest in extreme locations to avoid threats from predators. [[Kenya]]'s caustic [[Rift Valley lakes|soda lake]]s are a perilous environment for a [[lesser flamingo]] chick, while [[chinstrap penguin]]s breed on a volcanic island off the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. In South Africa, declining fish stocks force [[Cape gannet]]s to abandon their chicks to search for food, presenting [[great white pelican]]s with the chance to snatch an easy meal. Feathers can also be used for display. Male [[sage grouse]] square up to one another at their leks, courting [[Clark's grebe]]s perform an elaborate ritual to reaffirm their bond and thousands of lesser flamingos move in a synchronised display. In [[West Papua]], the small, drab [[Vogelkop Bowerbird|Vogelkop bowerbird]] uses a different strategy. The male decorates his bower with colourful jewels from the forest, and uses vocal [[mimicry]] to attract the attention of a female. Mating is filmed for the first time, the end result of a long and difficult quest featured in ''Life on Location''.<ref name=bbc-episode-5>{{cite episode |title=Birds |series=Life |credits=Produced by Patrick Morris |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-11-09|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ntlyx}}</ref>
