'''''Life''''' is a [[nature documentary]] series made by [[BBC television]], first broadcast as part of the BBC's "Darwin Season"<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/darwin/</ref> on [[BBC One]] and [[BBC HD]] from October to December 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/09_september/18/life.shtml | title=Life Press Pack – Introduction | publisher=BBC Press Office | date=2009-09-18}}</ref>  The series takes a global view of the specialised strategies and extreme behaviour that living things have evolved in order to survive; what [[Charles Darwin]] termed "the struggle for existence". Four years in the making, the series has been shot entirely in [[high-definition video|high definition]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/5795325/BBC-David-Attenborough-Life-series-goes-deeper-than-ever-into-world-of-the-wild.html | title=David Attenborough Life series goes deeper than ever into world of the wild | publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' | author=Khan, Urmee | date=2009-07-10}}</ref>

The UK broadcast of ''Life'' consists of ten 50-minute episodes. The opening programme gives a general introduction to the series, a second looks at plants and the remainder are dedicated to the major animal groups. They aim to show common features that have contributed to the success of each group, and to document intimate and dramatic moments in the lives of selected species chosen for their charisma or their extraordinary behaviour. A ten-minute [[making-of]] feature ''Life on Location'' airs at the end of each episode, taking the total running time to 60 minutes.

''Life'' is produced by the [[BBC Natural History Unit]] in association with the [[Discovery Channel]], [[Skai TV]] and the [[Open University]]. The original script, used in the British and Canadian versions of the series, was written and narrated by [[David Attenborough]]. In the [[USA]], the series premiered on 21 March 2010 with narration by [[Oprah Winfrey]] and will be shown in an 11-part run.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/02/oprah-to-narrate-nature-series-on-the-discovery-channel/ | title=Oprah to Narrate Nature Series on the Discovery Channel | publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' | author=Stelter, Brian | date=2009-11-02}}</ref>

The series is marketed internationally under the BBC Earth brand and is distributed by [[BBC Worldwide]]. It has already been acquired by several [[Latin America]]n broadcasters<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/bbcworldwide/worldwidestories/pressreleases/2009/10_october/mipcom_latin_america.shtml | title=BBC Worldwide brings Life to Latin America | publisher=BBC Press Office | date=2009-10-06}}</ref> and by [[Discovery Channel (Canada)|Discovery Channel Canada]], where it made its [[North America]]n première on 15 November 2009.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.worldscreen.com/articles/display/23034 | title=BBC Worldwide announces Canadian slot for Life | publisher=Worldscreen.com | author=Daswani, Mansha | date=2009-10-23}}</ref>

== Production ==

===Production team ===

''Life'' was the first series commissioned by the then Network Controller of BBC One, [[Peter Fincham]], just weeks after he took up the post in March 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/peter-fincham-the-reluctant-controversialist-457166.html |title=Peter Fincham: The reluctant controversialist |date=July 14, 2007 |publisher=''The Independent''}}</ref>. It was reportedly one of the most expensive documentaries ever ordered by the broadcaster, with a budget of [[Pound (currency)|£]]10 million (though the BBC have never confirmed this figure).<ref name="times">{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article1329349.ece 
|title=Is anyone a natural to replace Attenborough? |date=February 5, 2007 |publisher=''[[The Times]]''}}</ref> 
The Natural History Unit's production team includes series producer [[Martha Holmes (broadcaster)|Martha Holmes]] (''[[Life in the Freezer]]'', ''[[The Blue Planet]]'') and executive producer Michael Gunton (''[[Galápagos (TV series)|Galápagos]]'', ''[[Life in the Undergrowth]]''). Individual episodes were produced by Rupert Barrington, Adam Chapman, Martha Holmes, Neil Lucas, Patrick Morris and Ted Oakes. The specially-commissioned score was composed by [[George Fenton]] and performed by the Band of Life. The opening titles and brand imaging were created by [http://www.bdh.net/ Burrell Durrant Hifle].

In February 2007, Gunton revealed that the BBC were looking for a new narrator for the series owing to Attenborough's imminent retirement.<ref name="times"/> However, later that year it was announced that the veteran narrator would be collaborating on both this series and the forthcoming ''[[The Frozen Planet|Frozen Planet]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/sep/21/bbc.television1 |title=Attenborough is back - again |date=September 21, 2007 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''}}</ref>

=== Filming ===

The first year of production was spent researching possible stories for the series. The ''Life'' team contacted scientists and experts around the world in search of new discoveries to film, and new approaches to familiar subjects. Nearly three years of filming followed, involving 150 shoots on all seven continents, many of them full-scale expeditions to remote wilderness areas.<ref>{{Citation |last=Barrington |first=Rupert |title=Life |newspaper=''[[BBC Wildlife]]'' |volume=27 |issue=12 |date=November 2009}}</ref>

New camera technology was used to build on the cinematic techniques first employed in ''[[Planet Earth (TV series)|Planet Earth]]'', notably the pioneering use of stabilised helicopter-mounted cameras. The ''Life'' crew succeeded in using [[gyroscope|gyroscopic stabilisation]] to create steady shots from moving vehicles, even on rough terrain, allowing the cameras to track alongside reindeer and elephant herds for the first time. Miniature high-definition cameras were used extensively for the "Insects" programme. In the forests of [[Mexico]], the crew erected a spider's web of cables in the canopy to give the sense of flying alongside millions of monarch butterflies. In Zambia, they filmed from a hot air balloon to avoid disturbing the huge flocks of straw-coloured fruit bats.<ref name="wextra">{{cite web | url=http://www.wildlifeextra.com/go/news/bbc-life-mammals.html#cr | title=BBC "Life" – Mammals | publisher=WildlifeExtra.com | accessdate=2009-11-15}}</ref>

Following recent debate<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1568959/New-TV-scandal-as-BBC-foxes-viewers-again.html | title=New TV scandal as BBC foxes viewers again | publisher=''The Daily Telegraph'' | author=Nikkhah, Roya | date=2007-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nature-film-not-entirely-natural/story-e6frg6to-1111115259402 | title=Nature film not entirely natural | publisher=''[[The Australian]]'' | author=Foggo, Daniel | date=2008-01-07}}</ref> about the use of artifice in natural history programmes, the BBC were more candid about sequences which had not been filmed in the wild. Close-ups of wild clownfish would have disturbed their natural behaviour, so captive animals were filmed in an aquarium at a Welsh university.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/8340035.stm | publisher=BBC News Online | title= BBC is finding Nemo... in Swansea | accessdate=2009-11-17}}</ref>

Despite the best efforts of the film-makers, some sequences ended up on the cutting room floor. Scientists in [[Arctic]] [[Scandinavia]] had accumulated enough evidence to suggest that [[golden eagle]]s were the main predators of reindeer calves, but an attack had never been witnessed. After two summers tracking the herds in [[Finland]], cameraman Barrie Britton finally filmed a hunt in full. However, the attack had taken place nearly a mile away, and the footage was too distant to be considered for broadcast.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8315000/8315351.stm | publisher=BBC Earth News | title=Eagles filmed hunting reindeer | accessdate=2009-11-17}}</ref>

All of the filming kit for the entire shoot was provided by Films at 59 in Bristol.

=== Television firsts ===

The budget and timescale for the series enabled the producers to set ambitious filming challenges, and expedition crews brought back several sequences which have never been shown before. 

Some involved highly-specialised hunting behaviour that has only recently been discovered. In the shallow, muddy waters of [[Florida Bay]], one pod of bottlenose dolphins have learned a unique hunting technique called mud-ring feeding. [[Aerial photography]] shows the lead dolphin circling a shoal of [[mullet]], flicking its tail flukes to disturb mud on the seabed. The fish trapped inside the mud ring panic and leap out of the water to escape the trap, straight into the waiting mouths of the pod.<ref>{{Citation |last=Clarke |first=Tom |title=Life: Dolphin Genius |newspaper=''[[BBC Wildlife]]'' |volume=27 |issue=12 |date=November 2009}}</ref> In [[Kenya]]'s [[Lewa Wildlife Conservancy]], three cheetah brothers have learned to take on prey many times their own size. They are filmed bringing down an ostrich, but also hunt zebra, eland and oryx.<ref>{{Citation |last=Chapman |first=Adam |title=Life: Cheetahs hunting Ostriches |newspaper=''[[BBC Wildlife]]'' |volume=27 |issue=12 |date=November 2009}}</ref> A film crew travelled to the [[Falkland Islands]] to follow up reports of an orca that had learned to take elephant seal pups from a nursery pool. On the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Rinca]], the first footage of komodo dragons hunting a water buffalo corroborated new scientific evidence suggesting the dragons used venom to kill their prey.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1025349/Should-really-scared-Komodo-dragon.html | title=Should we really be scared of the Komodo dragon? | publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]'' | author=Fothergill, Alastair | date=2008-06-10}}</ref>

Other sequences had previously proved too difficult to film. The humpback whale heat run has been dubbed "the biggest battle on Earth", but the whales move so fast that underwater cameras struggle to keep up. The ''Life'' crew used cameras mounted on helicopters and boats along with a team of [[free-diving|free-divers]] to follow the action.<ref name="wextra"/> The biggest filming challenge was to show a year in the life of an [[oak]] woodland using timelapse photography. After capturing real-world footage of a [[Devon]] wood, the crew rebuilt the entire scene in a studio in [[Exeter]] and digitally superimposed 96 separate layers of footage to create the final one-minute sequence. The whole project took two years.<ref>{{Citation |last=Collins |first=Fergus |title=Life: A Year in a Minute |newspaper=''[[BBC Wildlife]]'' |volume=27 |issue=12 |date=November 2009}}</ref>

Super [[high-speed camera]]s capable of shooting up to 8,000 frames each second were used to slow down dramatic action. For the first time, these were used underwater to reveal the hunting behaviour of sailfish.<ref>{{Citation |last=Blakeney |first=Simon |title=Life: Delicate Sword-work |newspaper=''[[BBC Wildlife]]'' |volume=27 |issue=12 |date=November 2009}}</ref> They were also used to show '[[Jesus Christ lizard]]s' running on water, the courtship flight of the [[Marvellous Spatuletail|marvellous spatuletail]] and flying fish leaving the water.

The [[Pebble Toad]]'s strange escape method had been caught on tape for the first.The [[Waterfall Toad]] was also caught with it's unusual escape tactic for the first time.

The opening episode introduces the series by showing examples of extraordinary feeding, hunting, courting and parenting behaviour from across the animal kingdom and around the globe. In [[Florida Bay]], [[Common Bottlenose Dolphin|bottlenose dolphin]]s catch leaping fish as they attempt to escape a corral of encircling mud, whipped up with the lead dolphin’s tail. Other unusual collaborative hunting techniques include three [[cheetah]]s combining to bring down an [[ostrich]] and Antarctic [[killer whale]]s attacking a [[crabeater seal]]. In [[Brazil]], [[tufted capuchin]]s have learned to crack open palm nuts by smashing them with rocks. [[High speed camera]]s reveal [[flying fish]] taking an aerial route to avoid predatory [[sailfish]], [[Venus flytrap]]s ensnaring their unwitting victims and two male [[hippo]]s clashing over the territorial rights to a stretch of river. In some species, parents go to great lengths to protect their young. A mother [[Strawberry Poison-dart Frog|strawberry poison-dart frog]] carries each of her six tadpoles high into the rainforest canopy to the safety of a [[bromeliad]] pool, then provides them with nutritious unfertilised eggs. A female [[North Pacific Giant Octopus|Pacific giant octopus]] makes the ultimate sacrifice, starving to death as she guards her eggs. On [[Deception Island]], young [[chinstrap penguin]]s are trapped on a beach by ice-strewn seas. Abandoned by their parents, they must reach open water to feed. A lone chick fights its way through the ice, only to be ambushed by a [[leopard seal]]. ''Life on Location'' shows how the filmmakers collaborated with a French yachtsman and the [[Royal Navy]] to film [[Antarctica]]'s top predators.<ref name=bbc-episode-1>{{cite episode |title=Challenges of Life |series=Life |credits=Produced by Martha Holmes |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-10-12|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ncr13}}</ref>

In the opening sequence, an aerial camera zooms in on a solitary [[Komodo dragon]] from afar. This, states Attenborough, is the last place on Earth still ruled by [[reptile]]s. Though they may seem primitive, reptiles and [[amphibian]]s still thrive thanks to diverse survival strategies. In [[Venezuela]], a [[pebble toad]] evades a [[tarantula]] by free-falling down a steep rock face. The basilisk, nicknamed the [[Plumed basilisk|Jesus Christ lizard]], can literally run on water and the [[Brazil]]ian [[Coleodactylus|pygmy gecko]] is so light it does not break the surface. Reptiles are [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]], and some have developed unusual strategies to absorb heat. [[Namaqua Chameleon|Namaqua chameleon]]s darken the skin of the side of their body facing the sun. A male [[Common Garter Snake|red-sided garter snake]] masquerades as a female using fake [[pheromone]]s, attracting rival males which help raise its body temperature and thus its chance of breeding. [[Chalarodon|Malagasy collared lizard]]s conceal their eggs by burying them, but egg-eating [[Leioheterodon|hognose snake]]s stake out their favourite laying sites. [[Niue|Niue Island]] [[Laticauda|sea krait]]s lay theirs in a chamber only accessible via an underwater tunnel. Other reptiles guard their eggs. [[Horned lizard]]s drive off predators, but larger adversaries such as [[Masticophis flagellum|coachwhip]] snakes prompt a different reaction – the lizard plays dead. Komodo dragons prey on [[water buffalo]] in the dry season. They stalk a buffalo for three weeks as it slowly succumbs to a toxic bite, then strip the carcass in four hours. In ''Life on Location'', the Komodo film crew tell of the harrowing experience of filming the dragon hunt.<ref name=bbc-episode-2>{{cite episode |title=Reptiles and Amphibians |series=Life |credits=Produced by Rupert Barrington |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-10-19|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nj6dr}}</ref>

Intelligence, warm blood and strong family bonds have made [[mammal]]s the most successful group of animals on the planet: they can even survive the [[Antarctic]] winter. Here, a [[Weddell seal]] leads her pup on its first swim beneath the ice. In [[East Africa]], a [[Rufous Elephant Shrew|rufous sengi]] uses a mental map of the pathways it has cleared to outwit a chasing lizard. A young [[aye-aye]] takes four years to learn how to find and extract [[beetle]] grubs, food no other mammal can reach. [[Reindeer]] move through the [[Arctic]] [[tundra]], making the longest overland migration of any animal. Other mammals have evolved different ways of travelling long distances: ten million [[fruit bat]]s congregate at [[Zambia]]'s [[Kasanka National Park|Kasanka]] swamps to gorge on fruiting trees. Mammals employ different strategies to find food. At night on the African [[savannah]], [[hyena]]s force [[lion]]s off a kill through sheer weight of numbers, whilst in the melting Arctic, dozens of [[polar bear]]s take advantage of a [[bowhead whale]] carcass. Raising young is another important factor in mammals' success. [[Coati]]s and [[meerkat]]s form social groups to share the burden of childcare. A first-time [[African elephant]] mother needs the experience of the herd's matriarch to get her young calf out of trouble. The largest animals in the ocean are also mammals. The seas around [[Tonga]] are both a nursery and mating ground for [[humpback whale]]s. A female leads her potential suitors on a chase, the males battling for dominance behind her. ''Life on Location'' follows the never-before filmed humpback heat run.<ref name=bbc-episode-3>{{cite episode |title=Mammals |series=Life |credits=Produced by Ted Oakes |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-10-26|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nkpcc}}</ref>

[[Fish]], the most diverse group of [[vertebrate]] animals, thrive in the world’s [[river]]s, [[lake]]s and [[ocean]]s. Slow-motion footage reveals the behaviour of some of the fastest fish in the sea, [[sailfish]] and [[flying fish]]. The latter gather in large numbers to lay their eggs on a floating palm frond, which sinks under the weight. The eggs of [[Phyllopteryx|weedy sea dragons]], found in the shallow waters off southern [[Australia]], are carried by the male. In the fertile seas of the western Pacific, competition is fierce. A [[sarcastic fringehead]] defends its home, an old shell, from a passing [[octopus]] and a rival. In [[Japan]], [[mudskipper]]s have carved a niche on the rich [[mudflat]]s. [[Freshwater fish]] are also featured. Tiny [[goby|gobies]] are filmed climbing [[Hawaii]]an waterfalls to colonise the placid pools upstream, while in East Africa, [[barbel (fish)|barbel]]s pick clean the skin of the resident [[hippo]]s and feed on their rich dung in return. [[Wrasse]]s perform the cleaning duties on [[coral reef]]s, but [[jack (fish)|jacks]] also remove parasites by scratching against the rough skin of [[silvertip shark]]s. [[Clownfish]], whose life cycle is filmed in intimate detail using macro cameras, are protected by the fronds of an [[sea anemone|anemone]], but other species seek safety in numbers. A shoal of ever-moving [[anchovy|anchovies]] proves too difficult a target for [[sea lion]]s. Sometimes, predators have the edge: [[amalltooth sand tiger|ragged tooth shark]]s are shown attacking [[sardine]]s trapped in shallow waters off [[South Africa]]. ''Life on Location'' looks at the efforts of underwater cameramen to capture the sailfish and flying fish sequences.<ref name=bbc-episode-4>{{cite episode |title=Fish |series=Life |credits=Produced by Adam Chapman |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-11-02|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nqbkb}}</ref>

[[Bird]]s, whose [[feather]]s have made them extremely adaptable and enabled them to fly, are the subject of programme five. The courtship flight of the [[Marvellous Spatuletail|marvellous spatuletail hummingbird]] is shot at high speed to slow down its rapid wing beats. The male must rest every few seconds due to the energy needed to display his elongated tail feathers. [[bearded vulture|Lammergeier]]s, by contrast, soar on mountain thermals with a minimum of effort. A [[red-billed tropicbird]] bringing a meal back to its chick uses aerial agility to evade the marauding [[magnificent frigatebird]]s. Some birds nest in extreme locations to avoid threats from predators. [[Kenya]]'s caustic [[Rift Valley lakes|soda lake]]s are a perilous environment for a [[lesser flamingo]] chick, while [[chinstrap penguin]]s breed on a volcanic island off the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. In South Africa, declining fish stocks force [[Cape gannet]]s to abandon their chicks to search for food, presenting [[great white pelican]]s with the chance to snatch an easy meal. Feathers can also be used for display. Male [[sage grouse]] square up to one another at their leks, courting [[Clark's grebe]]s perform an elaborate ritual to reaffirm their bond and thousands of lesser flamingos move in a synchronised display. In [[West Papua]], the small, drab [[Vogelkop Bowerbird|Vogelkop bowerbird]] uses a different strategy. The male decorates his bower with colourful jewels from the forest, and uses vocal [[mimicry]] to attract the attention of a female. Mating is filmed for the first time, the end result of a long and difficult quest featured in ''Life on Location''.<ref name=bbc-episode-5>{{cite episode |title=Birds |series=Life |credits=Produced by Patrick Morris |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-11-09|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ntlyx}}</ref>

The sixth episode enters the world of [[insect]]s. By assuming a variety of body shapes and incorporating armour and wings, they have evolved diverse survival strategies and become the most abundant creatures on Earth. In [[Chile]]an [[Patagonia]], male Darwin’s beetles lock horns and hurl their rivals from the treetops in search of a mate. A [[damselfly]]’s chance to mate and lay eggs can be cut abruptly short by a leaping frog. [[Monarch (butterfly)|Monarch butterflies]] use their wings to power them on an epic migration to their hibernating grounds in the forests of [[Mexico]]’s [[Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve|Sierra Madre]]. Many insects carry chemical weapons as a form of defence. High-speed cameras show [[Ground beetle|oogpister beetle]]s squirting [[formic acid]] into the face of an inquisitive [[mongoose]] and [[bombardier beetle]]s firing boiling caustic liquid from their abdomens. Some insects gain an advantage through co-operation. When an [[American black bear]] destroys a [[bee]]’s nest, the colony survives by carrying their honey to a new site. Japanese [[red bug]] nymphs will move to a different nest if their mother fails to provide sufficient food. In the [[Australia]]n outback, male [[Amegilla|Dawson’s bee]]s fight to the death over females emerging from their nest burrows. As a result, all will die, but the strongest mate most often. [[Argentina]]’s [[Atta (genus)|grasscutter ant]]s form huge colonies five million strong. They feed on a [[fungus]] which they cultivate underground, in nest structures which have natural ventilation. ''Life on Location'' documents the Mexico crew’s attempts to rig up aerial camera shots of the awakening monarch butterflies.<ref name=bbc-episode-6>{{cite episode |title=Insects |series=Life |credits=Produced by Rupert Barrington |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-11-16|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nxks3}}</ref>

Mammals have adopted diverse strategies to hunt their prey and evade predators. As well as revisiting the cheetah and dolphin hunts first shown in episode one, the programme shows how a sure-footed [[Nubian ibex|ibex]] kid escapes a hunting [[red fox|fox]] by bounding across a precipitous mountainside above the [[Dead Sea]]. Slow motion footage reveals the fishing behaviour of [[greater bulldog bat]]s in [[Belize]] and [[grizzly bear|brown bear]]s at an [[Alaska]]n river mouth, the latter awaiting the return of spawning [[Pacific salmon|salmon]]. The play-fighting of juvenile [[stoat]]s helps train them to run down prey such as [[rabbit]]s, which are many times their own size. The alpha female of an [[Ethiopian wolf]] pack stays at the den to wean her cubs while other adults hunt rats on the highland plateau. The extraordinary nasal appendage of a [[star-nosed mole]] enables it to hunt successfully underground and, by using bubbles to detect its prey, underwater. A [[Bengal tiger|tiger]]’s stealthy approach to a group of feeding [[chital]] deer is thwarted when a [[gray langur|langur]], watching from above, raises the alarm. The final sequence shows a female killer whale taking [[Southern elephant seal|elephant seal]] pups from their nursery pool in the [[Falkland Islands]]. This is a risky strategy as she could easily become beached in the shallow water. She is the only killer whale known to hunt this way, but her calf shadows her moves, ensuring her knowledge will be passed on. Also close by were the film crew, who reveal how the sequence was shot for ''Life on Location''.<ref name=bbc-episode-7>{{cite episode |title= Hunters and Hunted |series=Life |credits=Produced by Adam Chapman |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-11-23 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p1n00}}</ref>

[[Marine invertebrate]]s, the descendants of one billion years of evolutionary history, are the most abundant creatures in the ocean. In the [[Sea of Cortez]], packs of [[Humboldt squid]] make night-time raids from the deep to co-operatively hunt [[sardine]]s. Beneath the permanent Antarctic [[sea ice]] of [[McMurdo Sound]], [[sea urchin]]s, red [[sea star]]s and [[nemertean worm]]s are filmed scavenging on a [[Pinniped|seal]] carcass. A [[fried egg jellyfish]] hunts amongst a swarm of [[Aurelia]] in the open ocean, spearing its prey with harpoon-like tentacles. In the shallows off [[South Australia]], hundreds of thousands of [[Majidae|spider crab]]s gather annually to moult. Many invertebrates have simple nervous systems, but [[Australian Giant Cuttlefish|giant cuttlefish]] have large brains and complex mating habits. Large males use flashing stroboscopic colours and strength to win a mate, whereas smaller rivals rely on deceit: both tactics are successful. A [[North Pacific Giant Octopus|Pacific giant octopus]] sacrifices her life to tend her single clutch of eggs for six months. As a [[Pycnopodia]] starfish feeds on her remains, it comes under attack from a [[king crab]]. [[Coral reef]]s, which rival rainforests in their diversity, are the largest living structures on Earth and are created by coral [[polyp]]s. [[Porcelain crab]]s, [[boxer crab]]s and orangutan crabs are shown to illustrate the many specialised ways of catching food on a reef. Marine invertebrates have a lasting legacy on land too – their shells formed the [[chalk]] and [[limestone]] deposits of [[Eurasia]] and the Americas. ''Life on Location'' documents the recording of Antarctic sea life and the birth of a reef.<ref name=bbc-episode-8>{{cite episode |title= Creatures of the Deep |series=Life |credits=Produced by Neil Lucas |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-11-30|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p4rl4}}</ref>

[[Plant]]s endure a daily struggle for water, nutrients and light. On the forest floor where light is scare, [[time-lapse]] shots show [[ivy|ivies]] and [[Uncaria tomentosa|creeper]]s climbing into the canopy using sticky pads, hooks or coiled tendrils. [[Epiphyte]]s grow directly on the topmost branches of trees. Their bare roots absorb water and trap falling leaves, which provide nutrients as they decompose. Animals can also be a source of food: the [[Drosera|sundew]] traps [[mosquito]]es with sticky fluid, and [[venus flytrap]]s close their clamshell leaves on unwitting insects. Sandhill [[Asclepias|milkweed]] defends itself against feeding [[monarch (butterfly)|monarch]] [[caterpillar]]s by secreting sticky latex from its leaves. The milkweed endures the onslaught because, like most plants, it produces [[flower]]s, and the newly-hatched butterflies [[pollination|pollinate]] them. After flowering, [[brunsvigia]] plants in [[South Africa]] are snapped off by strong winds, sending their seed heads cartwheeling across the ground. [[Saguaro|Saguaro cacti]] produce succulent fruit to attract desert animals which ingest and disperse their seeds. Some plants have adapted to survive environmental extremes. [[Dracaena cinnabari|Dragon's blood tree]]s and desert roses thrive on arid [[Socotra]], and coastal [[mangrove]] trees survive by filtering salt from seawater. [[Bristlecone pine]]s live above 3,000m in [[North America]]’s mountains. They have a six-week growing season and can live for 5,000 years, making them the oldest living things on Earth. [[Grass]]es are the most successful of all plants. Of their 10,000 varieties, two cover more land than any other plant: [[rice]] and [[wheat]]. ''Life on Location'' goes behind the scenes of a time-lapse sequence in an English woodland.<ref name=bbc-episode-9>{{cite episode |title=Plants |series=Life |credits=Produced by Neil Lucas |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-12-07|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p90d6}}</ref>

=== 10. "Primates" ===

Intelligence, curiosity and complex societies have enabled [[primate]]s to exploit many different habitats. In [[Ethiopia]], male [[Hamadryas baboon]]s restore discipline after a skirmish with a rival troop. In [[Japanese macaque]] society, only those members from the correct bloodlines are permitted to use [[thermal spring]]s in winter; others are left out in the cold. Examples of primate communication include a silverback [[Western lowland gorilla|gorilla]] advertising his territory though vocalisations and chest-beating, and the piercing calls of [[spectral tarsier]]s which help keep their group together. In [[Thailand]]'s rainforests, [[lar gibbon]]s use song to reinforce sexual and family bonds. By contrast, [[ring-tailed lemur]]s in [[Madagascar]] broadcast sexual signals using scent glands. A young [[orangutan]]'s upbringing equips it with all the skills it needs to survive in the forest, including finding food, moving through the canopy and building a shelter. On [[South Africa]]'s [[Cape Peninsula]], [[chacma baboon]]s forage kelp beds exposed by the lowest tides for nutritious [[Egg case (skates, rays and sharks)|shark egg]]s and [[mussel]]s. [[White-headed Capuchin|White-faced capuchin]]s collect [[clam]]s in [[Costa Rica]]'s coastal [[mangrove]]s, but lack the powerful jaws to pierce the shells. Their solution is to beat the shellfish against trees or rocks, which eventually exhausts the muscle that holds the shell closed. ''Life on Location'' follows camerawoman Justine Evans to [[Guinea]] to film [[tool use]] in [[chimpanzee]]s. Dextrous hand movements enable them to dip for [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s using plant stems. They have also learned to crack nuts using precise and efficient blows with a stone. One male chimp is filmed sharing his stone with a female.<ref name=bbc-episode-10>{{cite episode |title=Primates |series=Life |credits=Produced by Patrick Morris |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-12-14|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00pcm3h}}</ref>
