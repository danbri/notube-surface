The opening episode introduces the series by showing examples of extraordinary feeding, hunting, courting and parenting behaviour from across the animal kingdom and around the globe. In [[Florida Bay]], [[Common Bottlenose Dolphin|bottlenose dolphin]]s catch leaping fish as they attempt to escape a corral of encircling mud, whipped up with the lead dolphinâ€™s tail. Other unusual collaborative hunting techniques include three [[cheetah]]s combining to bring down an [[ostrich]] and Antarctic [[killer whale]]s attacking a [[crabeater seal]]. In [[Brazil]], [[tufted capuchin]]s have learned to crack open palm nuts by smashing them with rocks. [[High speed camera]]s reveal [[flying fish]] taking an aerial route to avoid predatory [[sailfish]], [[Venus flytrap]]s ensnaring their unwitting victims and two male [[hippo]]s clashing over the territorial rights to a stretch of river. In some species, parents go to great lengths to protect their young. A mother [[Strawberry Poison-dart Frog|strawberry poison-dart frog]] carries each of her six tadpoles high into the rainforest canopy to the safety of a [[bromeliad]] pool, then provides them with nutritious unfertilised eggs. A female [[North Pacific Giant Octopus|Pacific giant octopus]] makes the ultimate sacrifice, starving to death as she guards her eggs. On [[Deception Island]], young [[chinstrap penguin]]s are trapped on a beach by ice-strewn seas. Abandoned by their parents, they must reach open water to feed. A lone chick fights its way through the ice, only to be ambushed by a [[leopard seal]]. ''Life on Location'' shows how the filmmakers collaborated with a French yachtsman and the [[Royal Navy]] to film [[Antarctica]]'s top predators.<ref name=bbc-episode-1>{{cite episode |title=Challenges of Life |series=Life |credits=Produced by Martha Holmes |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-10-12|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ncr13}}</ref>
