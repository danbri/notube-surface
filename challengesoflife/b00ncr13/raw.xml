                       <p begin="0:00:21.200" end="0:00:22.720">Our planet may be home</p>
                       <p begin="0:00:22.760" end="0:00:26.560">to 30 million different kinds of animals and plants.</p>
                       <p begin="0:00:26.600" end="0:00:30.960">Each individual locked in its own life-long fight for survival.</p>
                       <p begin="0:00:32.520" end="0:00:36.640">Everywhere you look, on land or in the ocean, there are extraordinary</p>
                       <p begin="0:00:36.680" end="0:00:40.920">examples of the lengths living things go to to stay alive.</p>
                       <p begin="0:00:45.160" end="0:00:47.440">This is the coast of Florida.</p>
                       <p begin="0:00:49.520" end="0:00:52.120">Here, strange scars on the sea bed</p>
                       <p begin="0:00:52.160" end="0:00:55.560">hint at one animal's remarkable strategy.</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:00.920" end="0:01:03.000">These are bottlenose dolphins,</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:03.040" end="0:01:05.960">one of the most intelligent animals on Earth.</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:07.280" end="0:01:12.440">Their prey is very elusive, fast-swimming fish.</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:12.480" end="0:01:17.520">But the dolphins have invented a completely new way of hunting.</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:20.840" end="0:01:25.800">By beating its tail down hard, this dolphin stirs up the shallow silt.</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:32.680" end="0:01:35.040">And by swimming in a tight circle</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:35.080" end="0:01:39.480">it creates a ring of mushrooming mud around a shoal of fish.</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:59.240" end="0:02:03.440">The contracting ring traps the fish just like a net.</p>
                       <p begin="0:02:03.480" end="0:02:06.400">Panicked, the fish jump to escape.</p>
                       <p begin="0:02:08.240" end="0:02:11.240">Right into the open mouths of the waiting dolphins.</p>
                       <p begin="0:02:24.000" end="0:02:27.320">Again and again, the lead dolphin creates a circle,</p>
                       <p begin="0:02:27.360" end="0:02:30.200">before they all line up with perfect timing.</p>
                       <p begin="0:02:57.280" end="0:03:04.440">These dolphins are the only ones known to have developed this hunting behaviour and it gives them an edge.</p>
                       <p begin="0:03:08.840" end="0:03:13.520">This sort of advantage may mean the difference between life and death</p>
                       <p begin="0:03:13.560" end="0:03:15.640">in the survival of the fittest.</p>
                       <p begin="0:03:21.320" end="0:03:25.560">This series reveals the most spectacular and extraordinary</p>
                       <p begin="0:03:25.600" end="0:03:30.040">strategies that animals and plants have developed to stay alive.</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:06.200" end="0:04:09.720">For every creature, every day is full of challenges,</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:09.760" end="0:04:14.880">all of which must be overcome, somehow, in order to survive.</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:26.600" end="0:04:30.440">Kenya, famous for its big cats.</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:30.480" end="0:04:32.280">The supreme hunters.</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:44.320" end="0:04:48.560">Cheetahs specialise in hunting at speed.</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:48.600" end="0:04:52.280">Though fast, they are fragile creatures,</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:52.320" end="0:04:55.200">built to sprint after small prey.</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:55.240" end="0:04:57.600">They don't have the strength or weight of a lion</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:57.640" end="0:04:59.120">to bring down larger animals.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:02.480" end="0:05:04.320">This male is different.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:04.360" end="0:05:08.720">He doesn't hunt alone. He's learnt that there is strength in numbers.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:22.720" end="0:05:27.560">But here there are not just two, but three cheetahs.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:27.600" end="0:05:29.560">A band of brothers.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:36.360" end="0:05:40.400">They have changed their tactics and, by doing so,</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:40.440" end="0:05:43.320">have taken their prey by surprise.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:43.360" end="0:05:46.520">They have learnt that working together</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:46.560" end="0:05:48.960">they can bring down large prey.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:53.600" end="0:05:55.120">An ostrich.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:55.160" end="0:05:59.440">A bird that towers over a cheetah and is more than twice as heavy.</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:01.000" end="0:06:05.800">It can't fly to escape danger, but it can lash out with a deadly kick.</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:07.520" end="0:06:11.440">A female, unaware as yet, of any danger.</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:17.440" end="0:06:20.920">Even with three of them this is still highly risky.</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:20.960" end="0:06:26.200">If one gets injured the other two couldn't hope to tackle such large prey.</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:34.680" end="0:06:38.760">On the other hand, if they get it right, the rewards</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:38.800" end="0:06:40.120">are huge.</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:47.960" end="0:06:51.960">The male has spotted one of the brothers, but only one.</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:52.000" end="0:06:53.560">It's not too worried.</p>
                       <p begin="0:07:06.560" end="0:07:08.560">Then suddenly there are three!</p>
                       <p begin="0:07:20.240" end="0:07:22.840">The female is slower to realise the danger</p>
                       <p begin="0:07:22.880" end="0:07:24.880">and the cheetahs switch targets.</p>
                       <p begin="0:07:50.840" end="0:07:56.720">It takes the combined effort and weight of all three brothers to bring down this powerful bird.</p>
                       <p begin="0:07:56.760" end="0:08:00.280">Even now the ostrich could land a fatal kick.</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:08.280" end="0:08:10.440">So far, the brothers are winning.</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:10.480" end="0:08:13.640">Ostriches have yet to find a way to foil such tactics.</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:17.160" end="0:08:21.920">Other animals have also evolved surprising tactics to outmanoeuvre</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:21.960" end="0:08:26.840">the enemy, not with brute strength but with extraordinary weapons.</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:27.880" end="0:08:29.760">Madagascar.</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:31.320" end="0:08:35.440">A strange world where nothing is quite as it seems.</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:44.640" end="0:08:50.160">To hunt here requires stealth and subterfuge.</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:50.200" end="0:08:55.480">And living within the trees is a master of ambush.</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:55.520" end="0:08:57.200">A preying mantis.</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:58.760" end="0:09:01.400">Well camouflaged and lightning quick,</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:01.440" end="0:09:04.040">these insects are highly efficient predators.</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:22.440" end="0:09:25.320">But even they are outgunned.</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:32.240" end="0:09:34.960">A chameleon.</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:35.000" end="0:09:41.920">Its camouflage is exceptional because it can change its skin colour to match its surroundings.</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:49.000" end="0:09:53.040">Its eyes move independently to spot prey.</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:57.080" end="0:10:01.680">It creeps towards to its victim, until just in range.</p>
                       <p begin="0:10:06.640" end="0:10:09.680">Then it unleashes a super weapon.</p>
                       <p begin="0:10:09.720" end="0:10:14.080">Its tongue shoots out at 15 metres per second.</p>
                       <p begin="0:10:18.440" end="0:10:23.600">And not only hits, but grasps its target.</p>
                       <p begin="0:10:39.120" end="0:10:41.960">But few hunters are always successful.</p>
                       <p begin="0:10:42.000" end="0:10:45.080">For them a hunt is just one meal.</p>
                       <p begin="0:10:45.120" end="0:10:47.640">For prey, the stakes are higher.</p>
                       <p begin="0:10:47.680" end="0:10:50.160">It's life...or death.</p>
                       <p begin="0:11:02.880" end="0:11:10.800">As Antarctica moves from spring into summer, the inlets and bays, once choked with ice, become free.</p>
                       <p begin="0:11:15.360" end="0:11:17.480">And animals move in to feed.</p>
                       <p begin="0:11:27.200" end="0:11:29.680">These are crabeater seals.</p>
                       <p begin="0:11:29.720" end="0:11:36.720">They don't actually eat crabs, but krill, small shrimps that swarm in their billions in these waters.</p>
                       <p begin="0:11:50.040" end="0:11:54.200">Resting on a large ice floe, these crabeaters are safe.</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:04.280" end="0:12:09.960">But as soon as they enter the water, they are on their guard,</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:10.000" end="0:12:11.840">for good reason.</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:15.680" end="0:12:16.920">Killer whales.</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:20.320" end="0:12:25.320">Here in Antarctica, many killer whales prey only on fish.</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:25.360" end="0:12:30.560">But these whales are different, they specialise in hunting seals.</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:43.560" end="0:12:50.240">This seal swimming to open water is unaware of the danger heading his way.</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:52.760" end="0:12:54.600">Until now.</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:59.360" end="0:13:05.960">He's in real trouble. There is no escape unless he can hide behind this small piece of floating ice.</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:28.880" end="0:13:31.400">But he's been spotted and surrounded.</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:45.160" end="0:13:47.400">Now agility is his only chance.</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:47.440" end="0:13:51.560">He dodges for his life, staying as close as he can to the iceberg.</p>
                       <p begin="0:14:03.040" end="0:14:04.400">He's tiring.</p>
                       <p begin="0:14:05.560" end="0:14:08.920">And the whales tighten the circle, going for the kill.</p>
                       <p begin="0:14:37.000" end="0:14:39.880">But hunters don't always get their own way.</p>
                       <p begin="0:14:42.760" end="0:14:46.840">In the end, the seal's determination and skill, using</p>
                       <p begin="0:14:46.880" end="0:14:50.640">the ice for protection, kept him just out of reach.</p>
                       <p begin="0:14:54.080" end="0:14:57.160">And the whales move on.</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:01.640" end="0:15:03.880">Recently it's been observed that killer whales</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:03.920" end="0:15:07.600">are much more successful when hunting other types of seal.</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:07.640" end="0:15:11.960">Crabeaters like this put up too much of a fight.</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:26.120" end="0:15:31.480">For creatures living in the open ocean there is nowhere to hide from predators.</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:31.520" end="0:15:34.200">But there is safety in numbers.</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:59.800" end="0:16:03.880">One fish, however, has evolved a different escape tactic.</p>
                       <p begin="0:16:07.840" end="0:16:11.840">To leave the water completely, take to the air and fly!</p>
                       <p begin="0:16:18.240" end="0:16:22.040">After a huge effort to get airborne, flying fish</p>
                       <p begin="0:16:22.080" end="0:16:26.240">can glide 200 metres or so, to escape the predators chasing them.</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:11.560" end="0:17:16.640">Not all animals are hunters, many are vegetarians.</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:16.680" end="0:17:21.680">But the battle between animals and plants can also be intense.</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:24.760" end="0:17:27.640">Boa Vista, central Brazil.</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:30.040" end="0:17:34.360">This valley is peppered with strangely pitted rocks.</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:44.320" end="0:17:53.880">These are not natural formations but the legacy of a long struggle between one animal and one plant.</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:55.840" end="0:18:00.880">Brown-tufted capuchins, highly intelligent monkeys.</p>
                       <p begin="0:18:00.920" end="0:18:04.360">They spend their nights in the safety of caves,</p>
                       <p begin="0:18:04.400" end="0:18:07.000">emerging each morning to find food.</p>
                       <p begin="0:18:13.200" end="0:18:16.320">Down in the valley is a particular favourite.</p>
                       <p begin="0:18:16.360" end="0:18:18.440">A nut palm.</p>
                       <p begin="0:18:18.480" end="0:18:24.120">The palms produce huge seeds, but they have very strong shells</p>
                       <p begin="0:18:24.160" end="0:18:27.640">that protect them against attack from hungry animals.</p>
                       <p begin="0:18:34.880" end="0:18:39.160">For the capuchins this is a war of attrition.</p>
                       <p begin="0:18:42.720" end="0:18:47.480">They check which seed is the ripest, and the battle commences.</p>
                       <p begin="0:18:53.720" end="0:18:59.080">The first job is to tear the tough fibrous husk from the nut.</p>
                       <p begin="0:19:03.800" end="0:19:07.440">He doesn't try to crack the nut straight away,</p>
                       <p begin="0:19:07.480" end="0:19:09.520">but drops it to the ground.</p>
                       <p begin="0:19:09.560" end="0:19:15.400">He's learnt that a nut should be given a week or so drying in the sun.</p>
                       <p begin="0:19:15.440" end="0:19:17.920">These are ones he prepared earlier.</p>
                       <p begin="0:19:17.960" end="0:19:20.240">He taps them to see if they're ready.</p>
                       <p begin="0:19:32.720" end="0:19:36.520">This huge flat rock is his anvil.</p>
                       <p begin="0:19:48.680" end="0:19:50.400">And this is a hammer.</p>
                       <p begin="0:19:51.680" end="0:19:56.560">It's made of a different and much harder rock than the anvil.</p>
                       <p begin="0:19:59.400" end="0:20:02.520">Now something extraordinary happens.</p>
                       <p begin="0:20:15.240" end="0:20:19.960">The capuchins' use of these stone tools requires an exceptional level</p>
                       <p begin="0:20:20.000" end="0:20:23.440">of intelligence, planning and dexterity.</p>
                       <p begin="0:20:36.960" end="0:20:42.560">The nut finally cracks and exposes a rich, oily kernel.</p>
                       <p begin="0:20:49.120" end="0:20:54.480">Youngsters watch and imitate the adults, just as human toddlers do.</p>
                       <p begin="0:20:54.520" end="0:20:56.720">If they are to become independent,</p>
                       <p begin="0:20:56.760" end="0:20:59.320">they must learn to crack their own nuts.</p>
                       <p begin="0:21:05.520" end="0:21:10.080">But the learning process is long, with many frustrations.</p>
                       <p begin="0:21:13.520" end="0:21:17.960">They learn early on that to do a job properly,</p>
                       <p begin="0:21:18.000" end="0:21:20.480">you need the right tool.</p>
                       <p begin="0:21:30.120" end="0:21:33.400">It can take eight years for a capuchin to master this art</p>
                       <p begin="0:21:33.440" end="0:21:37.240">and overcome the palm's formidable defences.</p>
                       <p begin="0:21:47.920" end="0:21:52.960">But some plants have turned the tables and feed on animals.</p>
                       <p begin="0:21:57.840" end="0:22:02.720">This is a highly sophisticated trap. The bait,</p>
                       <p begin="0:22:02.760" end="0:22:07.600">sugary nectar around the rim of the disc.</p>
                       <p begin="0:22:07.640" end="0:22:15.360">The triggers, fine hairs, two of which have to be touched within 20 seconds of each other.</p>
                       <p begin="0:22:23.720" end="0:22:29.640">The victim, a fly which finds the colour and nectar irresistible.</p>
                       <p begin="0:22:38.040" end="0:22:39.040">One.</p>
                       <p begin="0:22:52.000" end="0:22:53.000">Two.</p>
                       <p begin="0:23:00.840" end="0:23:07.120">When triggered, the trap snaps shut so fast that the fly is imprisoned.</p>
                       <p begin="0:23:16.360" end="0:23:20.520">The Venus flytrap now slowly digests its victim.</p>
                       <p begin="0:23:36.160" end="0:23:39.960">Life's challenges are more than just finding food.</p>
                       <p begin="0:23:40.000" end="0:23:45.440">In every animal's life there comes a time when its mind turns to breeding.</p>
                       <p begin="0:23:47.000" end="0:23:50.440">One creature's approach is mind-boggling.</p>
                       <p begin="0:23:54.360" end="0:23:56.240">Malaysia.</p>
                       <p begin="0:24:10.040" end="0:24:15.440">This strange insect has been lying dormant on the forest floor.</p>
                       <p begin="0:24:44.960" end="0:24:53.320">Once safe in the trees, these males hide among the leaves and begin an extraordinary transformation.</p>
                       <p begin="0:24:54.160" end="0:24:59.120">One that will make the difference between fathering offspring or not.</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:02.280" end="0:25:07.760">He begins by gulping in air bubbles, forcing them up into his head.</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:09.560" end="0:25:13.760">He then pumps the bubbles into the stalks supporting his eyes,</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:13.800" end="0:25:15.840">just like blowing up a balloon.</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:22.960" end="0:25:26.840">And this is what earns these creatures their name,</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:26.880" end="0:25:28.800">the stalk-eyed fly.</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:44.400" end="0:25:49.520">A few final adjustments to straighten out any remaining creases</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:49.560" end="0:25:51.600">and he's ready for action.</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:56.560" end="0:26:01.960">They may look unwieldy, but eyes on stalks improve not only his ability</p>
                       <p begin="0:26:02.000" end="0:26:06.960">to spot predators, but they are key when it comes to winning females.</p>
                       <p begin="0:26:16.280" end="0:26:24.320">In the evening both males and females gather and the males begin to size one another up, eyeball to eyeball.</p>
                       <p begin="0:26:24.360" end="0:26:30.440">Having the widest eye span puts you at the top of the pecking order.</p>
                       <p begin="0:26:32.440" end="0:26:36.760">The eye stalks are not weapons, they're measuring sticks,</p>
                       <p begin="0:26:36.800" end="0:26:41.080">used to gauge how big, and so how strong, a male is.</p>
                       <p begin="0:26:41.120" end="0:26:45.880">But there's trouble if two top males have exactly the same eye width.</p>
                       <p begin="0:26:45.920" end="0:26:50.280">Then the contest descends into a brawl.</p>
                       <p begin="0:27:01.360" end="0:27:04.160">Defeated.</p>
                       <p begin="0:27:04.200" end="0:27:09.560">The winner. He now has the right to mate with all the females nearby.</p>
                       <p begin="0:27:16.360" end="0:27:23.440">The rather gentlemanly way stalk-eyed flies settle their differences over females is not the only way.</p>
                       <p begin="0:27:23.480" end="0:27:25.520">Some animals are much more violent.</p>
                       <p begin="0:27:25.560" end="0:27:29.560">It's the dry season in Zambia.</p>
                       <p begin="0:27:30.560" end="0:27:39.600">The lagoons are either baked dry, or the mud is so thick animals get stuck, with fatal consequences.</p>
                       <p begin="0:27:41.560" end="0:27:48.880">This male hippo has been living in one small lagoon, but as it dries, it's turning into a death trap.</p>
                       <p begin="0:27:50.960" end="0:27:55.640">Understandably, the females that once shared it with him have all left.</p>
                       <p begin="0:27:58.240" end="0:28:03.160">Even if he wants to, he can't stay much longer.</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:03.200" end="0:28:07.280">He needs water to keep cool and females to mate with.</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:12.360" end="0:28:14.440">And this is where they all are.</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:14.480" end="0:28:19.600">Almost all the hippos in the area are in what is left of the Luangwa River,</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:19.640" end="0:28:23.680">because it's the last place where there's still deep water.</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:26.440" end="0:28:30.320">This bend is controlled by an all-powerful male.</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:30.360" end="0:28:34.480">Since the drought many more females have joined his herd.</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:37.720" end="0:28:42.040">THEY BELLOW</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:44.120" end="0:28:48.800">They are happy to live cheek by jowl, but any male who comes here</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:48.840" end="0:28:52.920">in the hope of mating must first defeat the overlord.</p>
                       <p begin="0:29:02.480" end="0:29:09.040">The wandering male arrives and has a decision to make - submit or fight.</p>
                       <p begin="0:30:19.800" end="0:30:22.640">Victory for the overlord.</p>
                       <p begin="0:30:22.680" end="0:30:29.600">His domination of his channel in the river remains and with it mating rights with the females.</p>
                       <p begin="0:30:36.800" end="0:30:40.680">The loser is alive, but is an outcast.</p>
                       <p begin="0:30:40.720" end="0:30:46.560">He retreats to another part of the river where it's so shallow that no females will follow.</p>
                       <p begin="0:30:48.680" end="0:30:53.640">His chance to father offspring is over for now.</p>
                       <p begin="0:30:58.080" end="0:31:04.520">For some animals the challenges of breeding are not about fighting but about courtship.</p>
                       <p begin="0:31:07.680" end="0:31:15.240">Among birds, displays, songs and rituals can reach extraordinary levels of complexity and beauty.</p>

                       <p begin="0:31:44.360" end="0:31:48.000">The ceremony starts with a series of graceful duets,</p>

                       <p begin="0:36:31.600" end="0:36:35.760">watch, making sure that they are safe from predators.</p>
                       <p begin="0:36:35.800" end="0:36:39.120">But they can't stay here for ever.</p>
                       <p begin="0:36:39.160" end="0:36:42.240">The leaf litter is drying out and tadpoles need water.</p>
                       <p begin="0:36:42.280" end="0:36:45.800">She must do something, and fast.</p>
                       <p begin="0:36:53.480" end="0:36:58.480">She needs to move them and so encourages one tadpole to climb on her back.</p>
                       <p begin="0:36:59.320" end="0:37:01.880">She now begins an epic journey.</p>
                       <p begin="0:37:02.880" end="0:37:06.200">But it's not to a pond, as you might expect,</p>
                       <p begin="0:37:06.240" end="0:37:09.640">she is looking for something very particular.</p>
                       <p begin="0:37:09.680" end="0:37:18.800">Her journey takes her across the forest floor to the foot of a tall tree and then she starts to climb.</p>
                       <p begin="0:37:33.360" end="0:37:36.640">For such a little frog it is a marathon ascent,</p>
                       <p begin="0:37:36.680" end="0:37:42.640">like a human mother climbing the Empire State Building with a child on her back.</p>
                       <p begin="0:37:45.920" end="0:37:50.560">She's looking for a plant, a bromeliad, growing on the tree.</p>
                       <p begin="0:37:55.840" end="0:38:03.720">It holds a pool of water at its centre, the perfect nursery pool for a developing tadpole.</p>
                       <p begin="0:38:06.400" end="0:38:09.640">In slides her youngster.</p>
                       <p begin="0:38:16.520" end="0:38:19.720">But this is only one of six tadpoles.</p>
                       <p begin="0:38:19.760" end="0:38:23.120">She must rush back down to rescue the others.</p>
                       <p begin="0:38:28.280" end="0:38:33.520">One by one she collects them and carries each to its own bromeliad.</p>
                       <p begin="0:38:56.480" end="0:38:59.200">But there is another problem.</p>
                       <p begin="0:38:59.240" end="0:39:01.640">The little pools contain no food.</p>
                       <p begin="0:39:05.040" end="0:39:07.640">So she has to provide it.</p>
                       <p begin="0:39:07.680" end="0:39:13.160">She lays an unfertilised egg in each pool for her tadpoles to eat.</p>
                       <p begin="0:39:19.120" end="0:39:22.840">And then she leaves.</p>
                       <p begin="0:39:27.920" end="0:39:31.240">But one egg won't sustain a growing tadpole for long,</p>
                       <p begin="0:39:31.280" end="0:39:35.400">so she has to return every few days with another egg.</p>
                       <p begin="0:39:42.360" end="0:39:47.400">Over the next two weeks she can climb almost half a mile tending her young.</p>
                       <p begin="0:39:49.120" end="0:39:52.760">An astonishing feat for such a tiny creature.</p>
                       <p begin="0:40:01.560" end="0:40:04.160">While she's busy delivering eggs,</p>
                       <p begin="0:40:04.200" end="0:40:08.480">the tadpole grows legs and its tail begins to disappear.</p>
                       <p begin="0:40:10.080" end="0:40:14.720">And then one day it leaves its bromeliad nursery for ever</p>
                       <p begin="0:40:14.760" end="0:40:17.080">and climbs out into the forest.</p>
                       <p begin="0:40:22.760" end="0:40:26.280">Whilst its mother has a well-deserved rest.</p>
                       <p begin="0:40:30.680" end="0:40:33.520">Birds are also diligent parents.</p>
                       <p begin="0:40:33.560" end="0:40:38.880">Over their lifetime they invest huge effort in just a few young.</p>
                       <p begin="0:40:43.160" end="0:40:46.720">But there is only so much a parent can do.</p>
                       <p begin="0:40:50.120" end="0:40:56.120">All along the Antarctic peninsula both male and female chinstrap penguins have been commuting</p>
                       <p begin="0:40:56.160" end="0:40:59.960">daily from the open ocean to collect food for their chicks.</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:08.720" end="0:41:13.760">Mouthfuls of krill, caught many miles away at sea, are regurgitated.</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:22.960" end="0:41:26.480">But one day the chicks wait in vain for food.</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:26.520" end="0:41:28.760">Their parents do not return.</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:30.800" end="0:41:33.680">The chicks now face life on their own.</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:33.720" end="0:41:37.400">This is the toughest time in an animal's life</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:37.440" end="0:41:40.520">and some are not going to make it.</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:46.360" end="0:41:51.760">Over the next few days, driven by hunger, the chicks make their way down to the shore.</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:53.920" end="0:41:57.680">Instinct tells them they have to head out to sea.</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:00.760" end="0:42:04.960">Built to withstand the cold, they have already accumulated</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:05.000" end="0:42:09.680">a layer of fat, and their outer feathers act as a waterproof shield.</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:11.240" end="0:42:14.280">But they still have to learn to swim.</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:37.600" end="0:42:40.160">The polar sea is challenging enough</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:40.200" end="0:42:42.640">but with a change in the wind,</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:42.680" end="0:42:46.160">a slick of broken ice has choked the bay.</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:50.760" end="0:42:54.600">For any penguin this ice presents a real problem.</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:56.840" end="0:42:59.600">But for the chicks it's a disaster.</p>
                       <p begin="0:43:04.560" end="0:43:09.000">They must get through this barrier to the open water, if they are to feed.</p>
                       <p begin="0:43:15.000" end="0:43:18.120">One, perhaps hungrier or braver than the rest,</p>
                       <p begin="0:43:18.160" end="0:43:23.440">leads the way and tries skittering over the top, while the others watch.</p>
                       <p begin="0:43:25.800" end="0:43:30.240">The ice is hard to swim through, and progress is painfully slow.</p>
                       <p begin="0:43:52.880" end="0:43:54.360">A leopard seal.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:00.880" end="0:44:04.920">This chick never had the chance to learn how to avoid the seal.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:04.960" end="0:44:07.200">Its end is inevitable.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:32.320" end="0:44:38.560">The leopard seal efficiently flays the chick, tearing off a small piece with each throw.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:42.440" end="0:44:45.160">Others take their chance.</p>
                       <p begin="0:45:24.560" end="0:45:28.600">But the leopard seal is now ready for its next victim.</p>
                       <p begin="0:45:46.040" end="0:45:51.120">It's a lottery, and the lucky chicks make it out to open water.</p>
                       <p begin="0:45:55.680" end="0:46:02.040">There is still an element of chance in life which an individual can do little about.</p>
                       <p begin="0:46:26.440" end="0:46:29.440">In the end, overcoming life's challenges,</p>
                       <p begin="0:46:29.480" end="0:46:33.720">whether finding enough to eat or outwitting your predators,</p>
                       <p begin="0:46:33.760" end="0:46:38.160">is only significant if life's final challenge can be met.</p>
                       <p begin="0:46:45.840" end="0:46:53.680">From a tiny frog dedicating weeks to her few cherished tadpoles, to an orang-utan who spends</p>
                       <p begin="0:46:53.720" end="0:46:56.120">eight years bringing up her baby,</p>
                       <p begin="0:46:56.160" end="0:47:00.560">individual animals strive to reach this one ultimate goal,</p>
                       <p begin="0:47:00.600" end="0:47:07.240">to pass on their genes and to ensure the survival of the next generation.</p>
                       <p begin="0:47:09.960" end="0:47:12.760">Ultimately, in nature,</p>
                       <p begin="0:47:12.800" end="0:47:16.040">that is what life is all about.</p>

                       <p begin="0:48:05.320" end="0:48:10.680">visited every continent on Earth, but the most challenging was Antarctica.</p>
                       <p begin="0:48:14.280" end="0:48:16.600">Here filming was only possible</p>
                       <p begin="0:48:16.640" end="0:48:21.960">with the help of an extraordinary range of people and organisations.</p>

                       <p begin="0:48:48.600" end="0:48:52.120">Once there, a small crew was put ashore on Deception Island</p>

                       <p begin="0:49:49.600" end="0:49:52.640">The teams had a two-month window</p>
                       <p begin="0:49:52.680" end="0:49:57.520">to film Antarctica's two top predators in action.</p>

                       <p begin="0:50:06.720" end="0:50:10.120">And the man to take us there was Jerome Poncet.</p>

                       <p begin="0:50:21.480" end="0:50:25.360">His yacht, the Golden Fleece, is not an ice breaker,</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:25.400" end="0:50:29.360">but Jerome has his own unique way of getting through.</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:30.960" end="0:50:33.360">He shunts one floe against another</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:33.400" end="0:50:36.520">to clear a way through like playing marbles.</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:36.560" end="0:50:39.760">Jerome, once he gets his teeth into,</p>

                       <p begin="0:50:42.960" end="0:50:45.800">So, maybe we'll be here for a few hours yet.</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:45.840" end="0:50:49.800">Jerome is determined to get through this channel.</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:49.840" end="0:50:52.240">We talk about hundred, hundreds of tonnes,</p>
