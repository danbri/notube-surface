[[Fish]], the most diverse group of [[vertebrate]] animals, thrive in the worldâ€™s [[river]]s, [[lake]]s and [[ocean]]s. Slow-motion footage reveals the behaviour of some of the fastest fish in the sea, [[sailfish]] and [[flying fish]]. The latter gather in large numbers to lay their eggs on a floating palm frond, which sinks under the weight. The eggs of [[Phyllopteryx|weedy sea dragons]], found in the shallow waters off southern [[Australia]], are carried by the male. In the fertile seas of the western Pacific, competition is fierce. A [[sarcastic fringehead]] defends its home, an old shell, from a passing [[octopus]] and a rival. In [[Japan]], [[mudskipper]]s have carved a niche on the rich [[mudflat]]s. [[Freshwater fish]] are also featured. Tiny [[goby|gobies]] are filmed climbing [[Hawaii]]an waterfalls to colonise the placid pools upstream, while in East Africa, [[barbel (fish)|barbel]]s pick clean the skin of the resident [[hippo]]s and feed on their rich dung in return. [[Wrasse]]s perform the cleaning duties on [[coral reef]]s, but [[jack (fish)|jacks]] also remove parasites by scratching against the rough skin of [[silvertip shark]]s. [[Clownfish]], whose life cycle is filmed in intimate detail using macro cameras, are protected by the fronds of an [[sea anemone|anemone]], but other species seek safety in numbers. A shoal of ever-moving [[anchovy|anchovies]] proves too difficult a target for [[sea lion]]s. Sometimes, predators have the edge: [[amalltooth sand tiger|ragged tooth shark]]s are shown attacking [[sardine]]s trapped in shallow waters off [[South Africa]]. ''Life on Location'' looks at the efforts of underwater cameramen to capture the sailfish and flying fish sequences.<ref name=bbc-episode-4>{{cite episode |title=Fish |series=Life |credits=Produced by Adam Chapman |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-11-02|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nqbkb}}</ref>
