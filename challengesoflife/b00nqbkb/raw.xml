                       <p begin="0:00:26.680" end="0:00:30.160">Ours is truly a blue planet.</p>
                       <p begin="0:00:33.520" end="0:00:37.120">Water covers most of the world's surface.</p>
                       <p begin="0:00:43.040" end="0:00:46.880">Here we are the outsiders.</p>
                       <p begin="0:00:57.280" end="0:01:01.040">But under the waves one group thrives.</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:13.040" end="0:01:16.480">Fish are masters of the waters.</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:21.360" end="0:01:25.640">And sailfish are the fastest of them all.</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:25.680" end="0:01:30.360">Their speed makes them one of the ocean's most fearsome predators.</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:33.800" end="0:01:40.320">Off the coast of Mexico, 30 sailfish have surrounded a ball of sardines.</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:46.520" end="0:01:50.880">To catch their prey requires more than speed alone.</p>
                       <p begin="0:01:55.760" end="0:02:00.160">In the tightest turns, fins maintain stability.</p>
                       <p begin="0:02:00.200" end="0:02:03.640">Their sickle-shaped tail powers them forwards</p>
                       <p begin="0:02:03.680" end="0:02:08.280">and that extraordinary dorsal fin helps intimidate their prey.</p>
                       <p begin="0:02:16.520" end="0:02:19.760">To the naked eye, the action is too fast,</p>
                       <p begin="0:02:19.800" end="0:02:23.160">slowed, their challenge becomes clear.</p>
                       <p begin="0:02:24.720" end="0:02:27.720">Just picking a target is hard enough.</p>
                       <p begin="0:02:29.320" end="0:02:34.360">Knocking it off balance, separates it from the shoal.</p>
                       <p begin="0:02:34.400" end="0:02:37.120">This requires extraordinary skill.</p>
                       <p begin="0:03:07.440" end="0:03:10.920">Not every attempt is successful.</p>
                       <p begin="0:03:13.720" end="0:03:20.560">But as more sailfish join in, when one misses another takes its place.</p>
                       <p begin="0:03:28.920" end="0:03:33.360">The shoal of sardines is methodically wiped out.</p>
                       <p begin="0:03:37.840" end="0:03:42.040">Sailfish are top predators, very little threatens them.</p>
                       <p begin="0:03:42.080" end="0:03:46.320">But for the majority of fish this is not the case.</p>
                       <p begin="0:03:49.560" end="0:03:55.480">For most fish the open ocean is extremely dangerous.</p>
                       <p begin="0:03:57.080" end="0:04:01.600">And some go to extraordinary lengths just to survive.</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:13.280" end="0:04:15.080">Flying fish.</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:20.840" end="0:04:24.840">Free of the water they soar on elongated fins,</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:24.880" end="0:04:28.440">leaving their predators far behind.</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:48.960" end="0:04:51.320">A flight of fish.</p>
                       <p begin="0:04:55.560" end="0:05:02.000">Escaping predators is not the only test facing the flying fish.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:03.560" end="0:05:07.960">They must also protect their developing young.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:10.560" end="0:05:16.440">These flying fish are searching for the one thing that will make this possible.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:18.000" end="0:05:21.960">In such a vast ocean it's not easy.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:24.480" end="0:05:26.920">They're in luck.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:26.960" end="0:05:28.760">A palm frond.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:30.800" end="0:05:34.920">It's a tiny island adrift in a huge ocean.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:37.360" end="0:05:42.080">And like an island it offers shelter, not for the flying fish,</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:42.120" end="0:05:43.680">but for their eggs.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:46.640" end="0:05:52.800">The females lay eggs on the raft, where the males fertilise them.</p>
                       <p begin="0:05:58.960" end="0:06:03.840">The first fish spawn and this triggers the others to start.</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:13.000" end="0:06:18.000">Soon thousands join the melee.</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:21.240" end="0:06:25.920">Innumerable strands of eggs are laid.</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:27.840" end="0:06:31.840">The raft starts to tilt under their weight.</p>
                       <p begin="0:06:58.520" end="0:07:02.560">The best place to lay eggs is right inside the frond.</p>
                       <p begin="0:07:04.280" end="0:07:10.040">For some the attempt proves fatal and living fish become entombed.</p>
                       <p begin="0:07:19.760" end="0:07:24.360">The raft starts to sink under the weight of so many eggs.</p>
                       <p begin="0:07:28.480" end="0:07:31.600">But this is far from a disaster.</p>
                       <p begin="0:07:31.640" end="0:07:37.960">Sinking away from the surface actually improves the eggs' chances of survival.</p>
                       <p begin="0:07:38.000" end="0:07:42.200">In just a few days, having been safely hidden in the depths,</p>
                       <p begin="0:07:42.240" end="0:07:43.560">they'll hatch out.</p>
                       <p begin="0:07:47.320" end="0:07:51.520">Other fish protect their offspring in different ways.</p>
                       <p begin="0:07:51.560" end="0:07:55.160">Some go to far greater lengths to care for them.</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:07.440" end="0:08:10.760">The shallow waters of southern Australia</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:10.800" end="0:08:13.640">are home to many strange creatures.</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:24.520" end="0:08:28.760">It's a fairytale world of sea horses...</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:32.480" end="0:08:34.680">..stargazers...</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:37.840" end="0:08:39.560">..and stingrays.</p>
                       <p begin="0:08:43.520" end="0:08:49.480">But none compare with the beauty of the weedy sea dragon.</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:00.640" end="0:09:05.160">The dragon's tiny fins beat frantically</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:05.200" end="0:09:08.480">to prevent the current from sweeping it away.</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:18.840" end="0:09:21.120">It's the beginning of spring,</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:21.160" end="0:09:25.240">the season when sea dragons begin their courtship.</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:33.720" end="0:09:38.400">And in the evening light, they start to dance.</p>
                       <p begin="0:09:56.800" end="0:10:02.960">In a graceful duet, each partner mirrors the actions of the other.</p>
                       <p begin="0:10:40.480" end="0:10:45.280">Darkness will soon draw a veil over the pair</p>
                       <p begin="0:10:45.320" end="0:10:48.920">but they will dance on, into the night.</p>
                       <p begin="0:11:00.840" end="0:11:05.320">Two months later, and the result of their courtship is revealed.</p>
                       <p begin="0:11:13.560" end="0:11:18.960">It's the male and he's the one that's carrying the eggs,</p>
                       <p begin="0:11:19.000" end="0:11:22.880">with rows and rows of them embedded in his tail.</p>
                       <p begin="0:11:25.040" end="0:11:29.400">That night the female transferred her eggs to him.</p>
                       <p begin="0:11:29.440" end="0:11:32.480">Since then, the male alone has cared for them.</p>
                       <p begin="0:11:34.040" end="0:11:38.120">By carrying them with him he's kept them safe.</p>
                       <p begin="0:11:47.920" end="0:11:52.080">And now it's time for his efforts to be rewarded.</p>
                       <p begin="0:11:55.480" end="0:11:58.520">The eggs are ready to hatch.</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:09.200" end="0:12:11.920">In the calm of a summer morning</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:11.960" end="0:12:17.320">a baby sea dragon, with yolk sac still attached, is born.</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:25.840" end="0:12:28.560">The weed bed shelters older dragons</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:28.600" end="0:12:31.920">that are already able to feed themselves.</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:43.000" end="0:12:46.200">Although these dragons were well cared for by their father,</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:46.240" end="0:12:49.240">now they must find their own way in the world.</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:54.040" end="0:12:55.920">There are fish, however,</p>
                       <p begin="0:12:55.960" end="0:13:00.640">which provide their young with a safe refuge for far longer.</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:03.640" end="0:13:06.800">The south western Pacific.</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:09.320" end="0:13:11.880">A convict fish</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:11.920" end="0:13:16.200">and it's something of a marine architect.</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:17.240" end="0:13:22.080">Underground it has created a labyrinth of tunnels.</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:22.120" end="0:13:27.920">This adult never ventures out of its burrow, what it eats is a mystery.</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:33.400" end="0:13:37.800">But it doesn't live here alone.</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:37.840" end="0:13:42.320">At another entrance faces peer out.</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:42.360" end="0:13:45.960">Juvenile convict fish.</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:46.000" end="0:13:51.240">Unlike their parent, the youngsters are not tied to the burrow.</p>
                       <p begin="0:13:54.040" end="0:13:59.880">And as they start to emerge, a trickle becomes a flood of fish.</p>
                       <p begin="0:14:07.720" end="0:14:09.240">There are thousands of them.</p>
                       <p begin="0:14:13.440" end="0:14:15.840">And they all help with the chores.</p>
                       <p begin="0:14:28.200" end="0:14:32.160">Many hands make light work.</p>
                       <p begin="0:14:52.400" end="0:14:55.480">The young fish swarm together.</p>
                       <p begin="0:14:55.520" end="0:14:58.760">Thousands of mouths gulping plankton.</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:08.880" end="0:15:12.800">What the adults eat must somehow involve these youngsters.</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:16.240" end="0:15:20.120">Whether the young feed their parents by regurgitating food</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:20.160" end="0:15:24.280">or through some other mechanism, we just don't know.</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:24.320" end="0:15:27.200">Whatever the answer, the youngsters provide</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:27.240" end="0:15:32.480">their parents with a meal and in return get a roof over their heads.</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:43.280" end="0:15:46.280">Producing young is just one challenge.</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:46.320" end="0:15:52.000">Finding food and somewhere to live are further trials fish must face.</p>
                       <p begin="0:15:55.200" end="0:15:59.880">The Californian coast, a wide range of species live here.</p>
                       <p begin="0:16:02.200" end="0:16:08.120">But all this life means competition for living space is intense.</p>
                       <p begin="0:16:19.920" end="0:16:23.280">Old shells are highly prized.</p>
                       <p begin="0:16:26.120" end="0:16:32.840">And this one is occupied by a sarcastic fringehead.</p>
                       <p begin="0:16:32.880" end="0:16:36.680">These fish are exceptionally quarrelsome,</p>
                       <p begin="0:16:36.720" end="0:16:39.880">they have to be, to defend their living space.</p>
                       <p begin="0:16:56.920" end="0:16:58.840">An octopus.</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:01.400" end="0:17:06.360">Inadvertently it's wandered into the fringehead's territory</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:06.400" end="0:17:07.920">and that can't be tolerated.</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:24.920" end="0:17:30.080">The octopus's impressive jab holds the fringehead at bay.</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:39.360" end="0:17:43.200">There is more to this behaviour than being bad-tempered.</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:44.920" end="0:17:50.640">The fringehead needs to defend its patch if it is to get enough to eat</p>
                       <p begin="0:17:50.680" end="0:17:53.240">and the octopus was competition.</p>
                       <p begin="0:18:02.400" end="0:18:06.200">Crabs are not the easiest of mouthfuls.</p>
                       <p begin="0:18:08.880" end="0:18:13.760">Because of the shortage of living space there are constant boundary disputes,</p>
                       <p begin="0:18:13.800" end="0:18:17.840">especially with other fringeheads</p>
                       <p begin="0:18:17.880" end="0:18:21.800">and this one has got too close.</p>

                       <p begin="0:18:31.680" end="0:18:34.160">..neither is prepared to back down.</p>
                       <p begin="0:19:01.560" end="0:19:05.920">Success, and it's quick to get back to its shell.</p>
                       <p begin="0:19:07.800" end="0:19:12.480">A fringehead can never drop its guard, there's too much competition.</p>
                       <p begin="0:19:18.440" end="0:19:23.320">Some fish have moved to places where they have fewer rivals.</p>
                       <p begin="0:19:37.680" end="0:19:42.880">A mudskipper a fish that spends most of its life out of the sea.</p>
                       <p begin="0:19:44.520" end="0:19:48.720">It can walk on land and breathe air.</p>
                       <p begin="0:19:50.280" end="0:19:53.600">Its life is very different from that of most fish.</p>
                       <p begin="0:19:59.120" end="0:20:02.800">A fish out of water maybe,</p>
                       <p begin="0:20:02.840" end="0:20:05.200">but they thrive here in Japan.</p>
                       <p begin="0:20:08.800" end="0:20:12.480">So what's made this upheaval worthwhile?</p>
                       <p begin="0:20:14.280" end="0:20:17.160">The answer lies in the mud.</p>
                       <p begin="0:20:21.360" end="0:20:26.000">As the tide retreats it exposes mudflats.</p>
                       <p begin="0:20:26.040" end="0:20:32.560">Sunlight hits the rich silt and tiny plants and animals flourish there.</p>
                       <p begin="0:20:33.840" end="0:20:37.720">All food for a mudskipper.</p>
                       <p begin="0:20:37.760" end="0:20:41.400">But life on land is not without problems,</p>
                       <p begin="0:20:41.440" end="0:20:44.120">it's hard work to find a mate.</p>
                       <p begin="0:20:52.040" end="0:20:55.760">Jumping high above the mud will get you noticed.</p>
                       <p begin="0:21:13.360" end="0:21:16.360">With eyes perched on top of their heads</p>
                       <p begin="0:21:16.400" end="0:21:20.560">the mudskippers keep a look out for both friend and foe.</p>
                       <p begin="0:21:22.200" end="0:21:25.960">And males fight those who intrude on their territory.</p>
                       <p begin="0:21:46.200" end="0:21:51.200">They must also take care not to dry out in the sun.</p>
                       <p begin="0:21:54.200" end="0:21:59.800">Rolling in the ooze keeps the skin cool and moist.</p>
                       <p begin="0:22:01.840" end="0:22:04.080">For this smaller species,</p>
                       <p begin="0:22:04.120" end="0:22:08.320">a better option is to retreat underground.</p>
                       <p begin="0:22:13.320" end="0:22:17.880">So he digs himself a tunnel down into the mud.</p>
                       <p begin="0:22:30.600" end="0:22:35.800">His heap of spoil is an indication of the extent of his excavations.</p>
                       <p begin="0:22:50.360" end="0:22:53.760">With the tide flooding the tunnel twice a day,</p>
                       <p begin="0:22:53.800" end="0:22:57.040">maintenance is a real burden.</p>
                       <p begin="0:23:03.800" end="0:23:07.240">The tunnel is more than a refuge from the sun,</p>
                       <p begin="0:23:07.280" end="0:23:10.600">it serves another very important purpose.</p>
                       <p begin="0:23:10.640" end="0:23:16.920">The tunnel is actually U-shaped and at the far end is a sealed chamber,</p>
                       <p begin="0:23:16.960" end="0:23:20.080">the walls of which are lined with eggs.</p>
                       <p begin="0:23:23.480" end="0:23:28.200">The eggs are kept in air as it's richer in oxygen than the water.</p>
                       <p begin="0:23:28.240" end="0:23:33.200">The problem is the air that's trapped here won't last for long.</p>
                       <p begin="0:23:33.240" end="0:23:39.600">So the male travels to the open end of the tunnel to gulp fresh air.</p>
                       <p begin="0:23:39.640" end="0:23:43.960">Back he goes down his tunnel where he releases it into the egg chamber.</p>
                       <p begin="0:23:45.600" end="0:23:50.080">Replenishing the oxygen on which the eggs depend.</p>
                       <p begin="0:23:52.720" end="0:23:57.800">He will repeat this hundreds and hundreds of times until his young hatch.</p>
                       <p begin="0:24:03.320" end="0:24:06.280">This lifestyle is very demanding,</p>
                       <p begin="0:24:06.320" end="0:24:11.320">yet the mudskipper has found a way around every problem.</p>

                       <p begin="0:24:24.800" end="0:24:28.040">Not for land, but for fresh water.</p>
                       <p begin="0:24:29.760" end="0:24:33.840">Hawaii is the remotest island chain on the planet.</p>
                       <p begin="0:24:36.080" end="0:24:39.400">These pools look the perfect place for a fish to live,</p>
                       <p begin="0:24:39.440" end="0:24:42.680">secluded and free from competition and predators.</p>
                       <p begin="0:24:45.000" end="0:24:50.160">Yet few contain fish, for one very considerable reason.</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:12.680" end="0:25:16.040">Surely no fish could swim up this.</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:17.200" end="0:25:23.720">But one fish comes from the ocean, intent on colonising these streams.</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:26.840" end="0:25:31.120">It's a tiny goby and it's a rock climber.</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:34.720" end="0:25:39.480">With pelvic fins fused into a disc, which acts like a sucker,</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:39.520" end="0:25:43.440">all the goby needs is a film of water to climb through.</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:53.000" end="0:25:55.840">The pioneer is soon followed by many others,</p>
                       <p begin="0:25:55.880" end="0:25:59.000">possibly following its scent trail.</p>
                       <p begin="0:26:23.600" end="0:26:28.080">They clamber on, ever upwards against the flow.</p>
                       <p begin="0:26:29.640" end="0:26:32.640">Drops of water fall like bombs.</p>
                       <p begin="0:26:45.400" end="0:26:49.000">False leads waste crucial energy.</p>
                       <p begin="0:26:51.880" end="0:26:54.280">Some must rest.</p>
                       <p begin="0:27:02.040" end="0:27:05.960">For others, the effort is just too much.</p>
                       <p begin="0:27:07.600" end="0:27:11.520">Many die in their attempt to reach to top.</p>
                       <p begin="0:27:39.960" end="0:27:46.320">Against all the odds a few heroic individuals do make it to the top.</p>
                       <p begin="0:27:49.520" end="0:27:54.240">They find themselves in a near-perfect fish habitat...</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:01.680" end="0:28:07.000">..where the gobies can feed and grow and breed in peace.</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:10.240" end="0:28:16.000">In time their own young will be swept downstream and out to sea</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:16.040" end="0:28:19.800">and the cycle will begin all over again.</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:32.800" end="0:28:38.440">Fresh water presents particular challenges for fish.</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:38.480" end="0:28:42.560">Nutrients can be in very short supply in spring water,</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:42.600" end="0:28:47.280">so here fish must take every chance they can to find food.</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:47.320" end="0:28:52.080">The rain that falls on these Kenyan hills percolates through the rocks.</p>
                       <p begin="0:28:54.080" end="0:28:58.000">Finally emerging as crystal clear pools.</p>
                       <p begin="0:29:05.280" end="0:29:10.120">Pools that are home to fish including barbel.</p>
                       <p begin="0:29:14.000" end="0:29:18.000">The fish share these waters with all sorts of creatures...</p>
                       <p begin="0:29:28.720" end="0:29:32.160">..including hippopotamus.</p>
                       <p begin="0:29:40.120" end="0:29:45.040">These giant vegetarians are no threat to the fish,</p>
                       <p begin="0:29:45.080" end="0:29:48.720">in fact they're key to their survival here.</p>
                       <p begin="0:29:54.800" end="0:29:59.360">After a night of grazing on land, these hippos return</p>
                       <p begin="0:29:59.400" end="0:30:02.200">to spend the daylight hours in the cooling waters.</p>
                       <p begin="0:30:16.480" end="0:30:19.840">And the barbel come to meet them.</p>
                       <p begin="0:30:26.760" end="0:30:30.760">Soon each hippo is trailed by a shoal of fish,</p>
                       <p begin="0:30:30.800" end="0:30:33.560">waiting for their breakfast.</p>
                       <p begin="0:30:35.400" end="0:30:38.360">Hippo droppings.</p>
                       <p begin="0:30:45.560" end="0:30:49.920">But it's not just the hippo's dung the fish are interested in.</p>
                       <p begin="0:30:53.320" end="0:30:58.160">When the hippos reach one particular spot in the pool,</p>
                       <p begin="0:30:58.200" end="0:31:00.640">they stand still and wait.</p>
                       <p begin="0:31:03.640" end="0:31:07.280">And the fish start to clean them...</p>
                       <p begin="0:31:10.320" end="0:31:15.440">..removing ticks, parasites and other tasty morsels.</p>
                       <p begin="0:31:18.280" end="0:31:22.360">To the fish the hippos are a mobile cafeteria.</p>
                       <p begin="0:31:26.320" end="0:31:30.920">The hippos seem to be enjoying the sensation.</p>
                       <p begin="0:31:33.640" end="0:31:36.120">The only thing that interrupts the feast</p>
                       <p begin="0:31:36.160" end="0:31:40.040">is the need to take an occasional breath.</p>
                       <p begin="0:31:46.800" end="0:31:51.600">Cleaning the hippo's skin was just the hors d'oeuvre.</p>
                       <p begin="0:31:51.640" end="0:31:55.440">Now it's time for the main course.</p>
                       <p begin="0:32:02.440" end="0:32:06.200">So, in addition to providing skin care,</p>
                       <p begin="0:32:06.240" end="0:32:09.160">the fish look after the hippos' dental hygiene.</p>
                       <p begin="0:32:09.200" end="0:32:12.800">It's an arrangement that suits both parties.</p>
                       <p begin="0:32:19.240" end="0:32:23.520">But perhaps it is the fish that are the overall winners.</p>
                       <p begin="0:32:23.560" end="0:32:27.360">For, thanks to the hippos, they are able to feed on</p>
                       <p begin="0:32:27.400" end="0:32:31.360">the abundant vegetation that would otherwise be beyond their reach,</p>
                       <p begin="0:32:31.400" end="0:32:34.880">growing around their pool, on land.</p>
                       <p begin="0:32:37.360" end="0:32:42.160">Providing a cleaning service is clearly a good way of getting a meal.</p>
                       <p begin="0:32:43.960" end="0:32:48.480">And there is cleaning to be done in the sea as well.</p>
                       <p begin="0:33:02.240" end="0:33:08.880">The life of this wrasse is centred on removing parasites from other reef fish...</p>
                       <p begin="0:33:12.920" end="0:33:16.680">..including predatory jacks.</p>
                       <p begin="0:33:21.920" end="0:33:26.160">Normally they would snap up such a little fish,</p>
                       <p begin="0:33:26.200" end="0:33:28.600">but this is an established relationship</p>
                       <p begin="0:33:28.640" end="0:33:30.480">and both sides know the rules.</p>
                       <p begin="0:33:34.400" end="0:33:38.840">With so many jacks and only a few wrasse in attendance,</p>
                       <p begin="0:33:38.880" end="0:33:41.640">not all the jacks are going to get cleaned.</p>
                       <p begin="0:33:45.040" end="0:33:49.680">But all this life attracts other predators.</p>
                       <p begin="0:33:51.280" end="0:33:53.520">Silvertip sharks.</p>
                       <p begin="0:34:09.680" end="0:34:13.480">The reef provides shelter for the smaller fish,</p>
                       <p begin="0:34:13.520" end="0:34:15.960">but the jacks remain exposed.</p>
                       <p begin="0:34:16.000" end="0:34:17.960">Yet this may be a chance</p>
                       <p begin="0:34:18.000" end="0:34:22.080">for the jacks to solve their cleaning problem.</p>
                       <p begin="0:34:22.120" end="0:34:24.760">They've spotted an opportunity.</p>
                       <p begin="0:34:39.680" end="0:34:44.920">Sharks have skin like sand paper.</p>
                       <p begin="0:34:44.960" end="0:34:47.360">And bumping into the sharks' flanks</p>
                       <p begin="0:34:47.400" end="0:34:53.120">helps the jacks to rid themselves of parasites and dead skin.</p>
                       <p begin="0:34:53.160" end="0:34:59.240">Perhaps the jacks find this a more effective alternative to the cleaner fish.</p>
                       <p begin="0:34:59.280" end="0:35:03.600">And soon swarms of jacks pursue the sharks.</p>

                       <p begin="0:35:09.960" end="0:35:16.400">Unsurprisingly all this attention bothers the sharks</p>
                       <p begin="0:35:16.440" end="0:35:20.920">and they head back to the blue water,</p>
                       <p begin="0:35:20.960" end="0:35:25.760">leaving the residents of the reef to resume life as normal.</p>
                       <p begin="0:35:34.640" end="0:35:38.760">Coral reefs are the richest habitats on Earth.</p>
                       <p begin="0:35:38.800" end="0:35:40.880">It's not surprising that,</p>
                       <p begin="0:35:40.920" end="0:35:44.600">with so many different kinds of animals living so closely together,</p>
                       <p begin="0:35:44.640" end="0:35:48.000">some extraordinary relationships have evolved.</p>
                       <p begin="0:35:51.080" end="0:35:56.440">A clownfish, a small and defenceless resident of the reef.</p>
                       <p begin="0:35:58.560" end="0:36:01.560">It seems to have picked a tough place to live,</p>
                       <p begin="0:36:01.600" end="0:36:04.320">amongst the tentacles of a sea anemone.</p>
                       <p begin="0:36:06.440" end="0:36:11.640">Each tentacle is armed with paralysing stings that can kill a fish.</p>
                       <p begin="0:36:13.200" end="0:36:17.640">Yet the clown fish are totally immune.</p>
                       <p begin="0:36:17.680" end="0:36:20.720">For this pair, the anemone is like a castle.</p>
                       <p begin="0:36:22.400" end="0:36:26.440">So long as they stay surrounded by the tentacles, they're safe</p>
                       <p begin="0:36:26.480" end="0:36:30.160">and so this is where they choose to lay their eggs.</p>
                       <p begin="0:36:34.080" end="0:36:36.960">After carefully selecting the site,</p>
                       <p begin="0:36:37.000" end="0:36:40.280">work begins on preparing the surface.</p>
                       <p begin="0:36:50.920" end="0:36:53.320">Both fish share in the labour,</p>
                       <p begin="0:36:53.360" end="0:36:58.400">though it's the larger female who decides when all is ready.</p>
                       <p begin="0:37:01.080" end="0:37:05.640">Lines and lines of tiny eggs are stuck to the rock and then fertilised.</p>
                       <p begin="0:37:19.920" end="0:37:24.720">They're laid so close to the anemone they will be safe.</p>
                       <p begin="0:37:26.280" end="0:37:31.080">And for the next seven days they'll receive constant care...</p>
                       <p begin="0:37:32.640" end="0:37:35.560">..much of which is provided by the male.</p>
                       <p begin="0:37:37.360" end="0:37:42.560">His seemingly obsessive concern for the eggs is for good reason.</p>
                       <p begin="0:37:42.600" end="0:37:46.400">His position in the anemone is far from secure.</p>
                       <p begin="0:37:48.280" end="0:37:51.080">The female watches his every move,</p>
                       <p begin="0:37:51.120" end="0:37:55.280">she's in charge here and if his efforts don't match up</p>
                       <p begin="0:37:55.320" end="0:37:57.960">to her standards, she'll get rid of him.</p>
                       <p begin="0:38:03.040" end="0:38:07.920">In line to take over are a host of immature clown fish...</p>
                       <p begin="0:38:10.400" end="0:38:14.160">..each waiting to move up the hierarchy.</p>
                       <p begin="0:38:20.560" end="0:38:24.920">For the male the best way to stay in the female's favour</p>
                       <p begin="0:38:24.960" end="0:38:27.640">is by lavishing care on the eggs.</p>
                       <p begin="0:38:29.800" end="0:38:34.920">So he focuses all his efforts on keeping them clean and healthy.</p>
                       <p begin="0:38:39.320" end="0:38:44.000">The eggs grow rapidly and soon their tiny beating hearts are visible.</p>
                       <p begin="0:38:45.560" end="0:38:47.760">It seems he's done a good job.</p>
                       <p begin="0:38:58.920" end="0:39:03.080">Clown fish can hide away within an anemone.</p>
                       <p begin="0:39:05.760" end="0:39:09.040">But most fish don't have this option.</p>
                       <p begin="0:39:09.080" end="0:39:12.440">For some, the only way of avoiding danger</p>
                       <p begin="0:39:12.480" end="0:39:15.480">is by hiding amongst their own kind...</p>
                       <p begin="0:39:19.840" end="0:39:22.120">..in shoals.</p>
                       <p begin="0:39:33.640" end="0:39:38.120">Packed close together, no one anchovy stands out.</p>
                       <p begin="0:39:40.400" end="0:39:42.800">By sensing and reacting to the movements</p>
                       <p begin="0:39:42.840" end="0:39:46.920">of their immediate neighbours, thousands can move as one.</p>
                       <p begin="0:39:55.000" end="0:39:59.560">For a predator, picking out an individual becomes nearly impossible.</p>
                       <p begin="0:40:17.960" end="0:40:20.880">The shoal's unity is its strength.</p>
                       <p begin="0:40:47.680" end="0:40:52.120">Yet each fish is acting from selfish motives.</p>
                       <p begin="0:40:55.880" end="0:41:00.200">Moving together, the fish confuse the sea lions so much</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:00.240" end="0:41:05.520">that they leave to look elsewhere for a smaller, less tricky target.</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:05.560" end="0:41:09.480">The sheer size of the shoal defeated the sea lions,</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:09.520" end="0:41:13.000">but there are fish that can overcome such strategies.</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:15.160" end="0:41:17.520">Off the coast of South Africa</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:17.560" end="0:41:22.880">this huge shoal of sardines is shadowed by a ragged tooth shark.</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:28.560" end="0:41:32.520">Other sharks join the menacing escort.</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:35.440" end="0:41:40.880">The shoal has been driven into the shallows by a cold ocean current.</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:42.720" end="0:41:45.800">And this gives the sharks an opportunity.</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:49.440" end="0:41:52.160">Hundreds have moved into position.</p>
                       <p begin="0:41:56.320" end="0:42:00.040">Sharks have a special sense, they can detect</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:00.080" end="0:42:04.080">the electrical signals their prey gives off when it moves.</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:08.680" end="0:42:12.520">It's a sixth sense that can give them an edge.</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:16.160" end="0:42:20.120">But with hundreds of thousands of fish crammed into the shallows,</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:20.160" end="0:42:23.800">the sharks now need only rely on their speed and agility.</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:27.880" end="0:42:30.280">As the first shark starts to hunt in earnest,</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:30.320" end="0:42:33.920">a feeding frenzy breaks out.</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:41.720" end="0:42:44.480">The shoal's defences are weakened,</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:44.520" end="0:42:47.760">there isn't enough space to manoeuvre.</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:47.800" end="0:42:52.040">And the sharks can gorge themselves.</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:57.600" end="0:42:59.320">Despite the casualties,</p>
                       <p begin="0:42:59.360" end="0:43:04.080">the shoal is so vast that the sharks have little effect on its size.</p>
                       <p begin="0:43:12.200" end="0:43:16.240">Fish not only come together in great shoals for defence,</p>
                       <p begin="0:43:16.280" end="0:43:19.160">but at other critical times in their lives,</p>
                       <p begin="0:43:19.200" end="0:43:21.160">when they're ready to spawn.</p>
                       <p begin="0:43:22.440" end="0:43:27.040">These events only occur for a few days each year.</p>
                       <p begin="0:43:32.840" end="0:43:36.800">Snapper are normally solitary, but they've travelled here</p>
                       <p begin="0:43:36.840" end="0:43:41.120">from hundreds of miles away to gather off the coast of Belize.</p>
                       <p begin="0:43:43.960" end="0:43:50.960">Along this one reef, cubera, dog and mutton snapper form huge shoals.</p>
                       <p begin="0:43:57.760" end="0:44:03.040">60 metres down, there is an eerie coolness to the scene.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:04.800" end="0:44:07.920">But things are about to hot up.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:15.680" end="0:44:20.920">It's the evening of the full moon, the tides are just right.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:27.160" end="0:44:31.440">A great column of fish leaves the bottom.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:31.480" end="0:44:35.880">As they rise through the water, small groups break free of the shoal.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:46.240" end="0:44:51.000">Each burst is led by a female, with the males racing behind.</p>
                       <p begin="0:44:55.280" end="0:44:58.640">As she sheds her eggs, they add their sperm to the mix.</p>
                       <p begin="0:45:14.000" end="0:45:17.520">By synchronising the time when they gather together,</p>

                       <p begin="0:45:43.240" end="0:45:46.960">..and straight into a dangerous world.</p>

                       <p begin="0:49:49.120" end="0:49:54.120">Bills nearly one metre long, scything through the water at break neck speed</p>
                       <p begin="0:49:54.160" end="0:49:56.400">are guaranteed to get the heart racing.</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:06.080" end="0:50:07.720">But Rick holds his nerve</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:07.760" end="0:50:12.600">as the sailfish pick off sardine after sardine right in front of him.</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:21.680" end="0:50:25.320">Almost as soon as it started, it was all over.</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:30.360" end="0:50:33.040">That was a wild feed show out there today.</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:33.080" end="0:50:34.800">Really wild.</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:34.840" end="0:50:38.280">Must have been 50 sailfish if there was...</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:38.320" end="0:50:43.800">Or 49, but very aggressive fish, very hungry, everybody on the move</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:43.840" end="0:50:46.560">and I had to just keep kicking and kicking and kicking</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:46.600" end="0:50:49.760">and kicking and kicking and kicking to keep in the action,</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:49.800" end="0:50:52.720">because after a while the sardine patch was eaten up</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:52.760" end="0:50:56.760">to just a little sliver and then it was over.</p>
                       <p begin="0:50:56.800" end="0:51:00.760">Nearly 2,000 miles away on the other side of the Caribbean</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:00.800" end="0:51:04.120">another crew is taking a slightly different approach.</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:04.160" end="0:51:06.960">They are trying to film flying fish.</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:09.560" end="0:51:15.120">The team sets out at dawn on the Hog Snapper, a commercial fishing boat.</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:15.160" end="0:51:20.840">Conditions are in stark contrast to the gleaming sport fishing boat in Mexico.</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:23.040" end="0:51:25.520">There's Doug he's ready for action, look.</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:32.920" end="0:51:39.400">They are hoping to use a local fisherman's expertise to put them in the right place at the right time.</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:39.440" end="0:51:44.400">Yeah, Roger that. All you catching there's food.</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:44.440" end="0:51:47.280">You catching dinner, lunch and breakfast.</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:49.160" end="0:51:53.800">It's not a big boat and the crew's bedroom has now become the kitchen.</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:53.840" end="0:51:56.680">We're having fried bacon and fried egg this morning.</p>
                       <p begin="0:51:56.720" end="0:51:58.200">Fried bacon and fried eggs.</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:00.400" end="0:52:02.480">I'm the trainee chef and I don't...</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:02.520" end="0:52:05.080">So I don't get to wear the white wellies.</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:09.880" end="0:52:13.760">Rather than racing around the ocean chasing the action,</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:13.800" end="0:52:16.440">the flying fish team have to sit it out</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:16.480" end="0:52:19.160">and wait for the fish to come to them.</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:20.800" end="0:52:24.400">Flying fish will spawn onto debris in the water</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:24.440" end="0:52:26.800">and the team tie on to a floating palm frond</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:26.840" end="0:52:31.560">to try and make sure they're close by in case the action begins.</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:31.800" end="0:52:35.360">And sure enough, they don't have long to wait.</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:47.720" end="0:52:51.600">Thousands of fish have massed below the surface,</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:51.640" end="0:52:54.320">all intent on reaching the frond.</p>
                       <p begin="0:52:59.400" end="0:53:02.680">And the frond is not the only thing</p>
                       <p begin="0:53:02.720" end="0:53:05.440">that they're trying to lay their eggs on.</p>
                       <p begin="0:53:27.760" end="0:53:31.120">The weight of the eggs sinks the palm frond</p>
                       <p begin="0:53:31.160" end="0:53:35.600">and puts an end to the spawning and to the crew's filming.</p>
                       <p begin="0:53:48.840" end="0:53:51.520">Well, it's moments like that we do the job for.</p>
                       <p begin="0:53:51.560" end="0:53:53.640">Everything was right.</p>
                       <p begin="0:53:53.680" end="0:53:56.880">The light was right, blue water,</p>
                       <p begin="0:53:56.920" end="0:54:00.680">the four tonnes of flying fish all going mental.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:00.720" end="0:54:03.040">Thanks, Barry.You're welcome.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:03.080" end="0:54:06.720">But now the fish's attention is turned to something bigger.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:06.760" end="0:54:09.960">Their spawning directly onto the boat.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:10.000" end="0:54:14.280">Barry is worried as he drags up a huge sheet of eggs.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:14.320" end="0:54:16.920">Gotta bring it on the boat and check it out.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:16.960" end="0:54:20.480">I cleaned this off like five minutes a go. Right?</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:20.520" end="0:54:24.480">Right now the problem is this, there's too many flying fish...</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:24.520" end="0:54:25.560">Too many...around us.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:25.600" end="0:54:28.480">If we moor through the nights with the lights on and stuff,</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:28.520" end="0:54:33.640">more and more will keep coming and what they're doing is they're actually laying on the boat now,</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:33.680" end="0:54:36.520">so the boat has become their object and that is not good.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:36.560" end="0:54:39.880">So basically you're worried that if we just stay on this drift</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:39.920" end="0:54:41.400">we're gonna sink the boat.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:41.440" end="0:54:45.760">Five hours from now that'll 3,000 pounds.Yeah, yeah.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:45.800" end="0:54:48.080">In the back here, it will sink the boat.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:48.120" end="0:54:50.520">OK, so we've got to leave this area.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:50.560" end="0:54:52.400">Yeah, we can't stay here.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:52.440" end="0:54:56.240">Just five minutes of spawning has produced this.</p>
                       <p begin="0:54:56.280" end="0:54:59.680">The team have no option but to move on.</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:01.400" end="0:55:05.640">The next day the search for flying fish begins all over again.</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:05.680" end="0:55:10.080">This time the team want to film the fish doing what they're famous for.</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:10.120" end="0:55:12.880">We've got some lovely shots from the spawning</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:12.920" end="0:55:16.120">but now the really hard bit of trying to get them flying.</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:16.160" end="0:55:19.040">Gonna be, gonna be a good challenge.</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:20.200" end="0:55:24.520">The fish are around, but they're all too far off to film.</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:29.360" end="0:55:31.880">The action is impressive this morning,</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:31.920" end="0:55:34.360">unpredictable but impressive but it's distant,</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:34.400" end="0:55:36.400">it's not happening next to the boat today.</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:36.440" end="0:55:40.240">They're either being chased off or they're just not interested. Look!</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:40.280" end="0:55:44.240">Look, look! Ah it's loads.</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:44.280" end="0:55:45.760">Ay, ay, ay!</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:47.320" end="0:55:51.640">The next day the crew decides to try a different approach.</p>
                       <p begin="0:55:55.880" end="0:55:57.360">All right, lets go.</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:01.640" end="0:56:04.160">Now they're just where they need to be,</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:04.200" end="0:56:07.120">but it puts them directly in the firing line.</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:08.680" end="0:56:11.280">I guess that's one!</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:17.840" end="0:56:22.640">Despite being bombarded, their strategy is paying off.</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:22.680" end="0:56:27.360">That was amazing, we spent a long time in that wee boat today. Thanks.</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:27.400" end="0:56:30.280">But the last two hours were just off the scale.</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:30.320" end="0:56:33.640">We were just getting shot after shot. We need...</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:33.680" end="0:56:37.680">Can't wait to watch it on the big monitor but it felt really good.</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:37.720" end="0:56:41.000">And Doug is right,</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:41.040" end="0:56:43.080">it worked.</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:43.120" end="0:56:46.920">Flying fish taking to the air and flying.</p>
                       <p begin="0:56:46.960" end="0:56:50.600">Slowed down 40 times.</p>
                       <p begin="0:57:11.360" end="0:57:14.800">By working with people more used to catching fish than filming them</p>
                       <p begin="0:57:14.840" end="0:57:18.800">the Life team have been able to gain a unique insight</p>
