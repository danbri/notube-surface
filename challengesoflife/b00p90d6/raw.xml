      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:25.12" id="p0" end="00:00:30.72">Plants have a family tree stretching<br />back nearly half a billion years.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:34.28" id="p1" end="00:00:38.72">They have developed an extraordinary<br />range of strategies to survive.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:42.28" id="p2" end="00:00:44.44">This tree is a bristlecone pine.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:44.44" id="p3" end="00:00:47.88">It's taken thousands of<br />years to reach this size.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:49.64" id="p4" end="00:00:52.20">It has seen empires rise and fall,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:52.20" id="p5" end="00:00:55.32">kings, queens and presidents<br />come and go</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:55.32" id="p6" end="00:01:00.56">and may have seen the sun rise<br />more than 1.5 million times.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:02.44" id="p7" end="00:01:06.72">Bristlecone pines are the<br />oldest living things on Earth.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:15.60" id="p8" end="00:01:19.64">Bamboo is the fastest growing plant.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:21.32" id="p9" end="00:01:26.92">It will be full-grown -<br />30 metres tall - in just 90 days.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:37.12" id="p10" end="00:01:41.88">Like animals, plants<br />are constantly competing for food.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:44.64" id="p11" end="00:01:46.56">Striving to produce offspring</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:48.92" id="p12" end="00:01:51.16">and battling against predators.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:59.24" id="p13" end="00:02:03.64">They will deceive and,<br />in some cases,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:03.64" id="p14" end="00:02:06.00">they will even hunt.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:31.96" id="p15" end="00:02:38.40">We often don't notice such<br />dramatic behaviour because,<br />to our eyes, it happens so slowly.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:38.40" id="p16" end="00:02:40.20">But if time is compressed</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:40.20" id="p17" end="00:02:44.16">and you shift perspective to<br />the plants' point of view,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:44.16" id="p18" end="00:02:47.24">their world comes<br />spectacularly to life.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:47.24" id="p19" end="00:02:49.04">The events in this woodland</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:49.04" id="p20" end="00:02:52.60">can build to a view of half a year<br />in less than a minute.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:36.80" id="p21" end="00:03:40.84">Like animals,<br />plants need food and water.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:53.68" id="p22" end="00:03:58.36">But what sets them apart<br />is their struggle for light.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:09.24" id="p23" end="00:04:15.36">Plants must have light in order<br />to grow and will do anything<br />to get as much as they need.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:19.40" id="p24" end="00:04:25.16">The forest might appear to be the<br />perfect place for plants to thrive.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:25.16" id="p25" end="00:04:28.24">Yet down here on the forest floor</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:28.24" id="p26" end="00:04:31.40">is one of the hardest<br />places imaginable</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:31.40" id="p27" end="00:04:34.16">for a young plant<br />to begin its life.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:36.28" id="p28" end="00:04:38.40">The canopy above is so thick</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:38.40" id="p29" end="00:04:41.36">that only a little sunlight<br />can filter through.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:46.00" id="p30" end="00:04:50.16">For this sapling, too<br />little light means death.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:00.68" id="p31" end="00:05:04.56">But plants on the forest<br />floor need not be passive.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:11.12" id="p32" end="00:05:13.92">If the light won't come to them,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:13.92" id="p33" end="00:05:16.88">they can go to the light.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:21.96" id="p34" end="00:05:24.80">But they still have a problem.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:24.80" id="p35" end="00:05:28.76">The light is 50 metres above them.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:28.76" id="p36" end="00:05:31.36">So, they must climb.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:40.24" id="p37" end="00:05:44.28">It's much easier to use another<br />plant as scaffolding.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:53.88" id="p38" end="00:05:59.36">But they won't get very high<br />unless they can hold on tight.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:03.48" id="p39" end="00:06:06.08">Like fingertips<br />searching for a hold,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:06.08" id="p40" end="00:06:09.92">this ivy's adhesive pads<br />grip the bark.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:12.28" id="p41" end="00:06:17.40">Instead of sticking to the trees,<br />some climbers use sharp claws.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:21.44" id="p42" end="00:06:26.44">The cat's claw creeper hooks its<br />tendrils into the tiniest crevices</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:26.44" id="p43" end="00:06:28.52">and hauls itself to the top.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:37.08" id="p44" end="00:06:38.92">With every metre it climbs,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:38.92" id="p45" end="00:06:42.72">the light gets a little stronger,<br />fuelling more growth.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:48.00" id="p46" end="00:06:53.12">This tendril of a passion flower<br />seems to flail aimlessly in mid-air,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:53.12" id="p47" end="00:06:56.60">but in fact it's searching<br />for an anchor point.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:04.00" id="p48" end="00:07:09.04">Its tendril coils on itself, pulling<br />the plant towards its support.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:17.48" id="p49" end="00:07:22.28">In a matter of just days, these<br />climbers make it to the canopy.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:25.96" id="p50" end="00:07:30.60">Now with light in plentiful supply,<br />these plants are able to flower.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:36.56" id="p51" end="00:07:39.32">Other plants have<br />a different strategy</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:39.32" id="p52" end="00:07:42.72">to find the light they need<br />in the crowded forest.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:44.80" id="p53" end="00:07:46.48">These are air-plants.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:46.48" id="p54" end="00:07:49.72">They grow on the upper branches<br />of tall trees</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:49.72" id="p55" end="00:07:53.36">and spend their whole lives<br />basking in the light.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:54.92" id="p56" end="00:08:00.00">But growing 50 metres above the<br />ground does have its drawbacks.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:00.00" id="p57" end="00:08:05.80">Most plants get water and nutrients<br />through their roots in the ground.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:05.80" id="p58" end="00:08:10.32">For an air-plant, with their<br />roots planted in the tree tops,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:10.32" id="p59" end="00:08:11.92">this isn't an option.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:13.04" id="p60" end="00:08:15.00">But they have a solution.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:17.56" id="p61" end="00:08:23.24">First, the bare roots have an<br />extraordinary ability to soak<br />up water like blotting paper.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:26.12" id="p62" end="00:08:30.48">The slightest rain or mist,<br />and they absorb every drop.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:34.48" id="p63" end="00:08:37.48">They also have a way<br />of gathering nutrients.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:40.60" id="p64" end="00:08:44.32">Their roots trap falling leaves<br />which eventually rot</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:44.32" id="p65" end="00:08:48.44">and provide the plants with their<br />own personal supply of compost.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:56.60" id="p66" end="00:08:58.60">20,000 different plants -</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:58.60" id="p67" end="00:09:03.92">orchids, bromeliads and ferns have<br />taken up this remarkable lifestyle.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:25.88" id="p68" end="00:09:30.36">For a plant to thrive, it must<br />not only get enough nutrients,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:30.36" id="p69" end="00:09:33.44">but also the right balance<br />of nutrients.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:34.60" id="p70" end="00:09:40.04">The soil in this waterlogged<br />bog is very poor quality,<br />lacking in nitrogen.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:42.08" id="p71" end="00:09:45.96">But these strange plants<br />have an ingenious strategy.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:48.52" id="p72" end="00:09:54.64">Their leaves are covered in<br />tentacles, tipped with droplets<br />of what appears to be morning dew.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:57.76" id="p73" end="00:10:01.16">These droplets give the<br />plant its name - the sundew.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:07.84" id="p74" end="00:10:12.28">They're sweet-smelling and<br />attractive to many insects.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:12.28" id="p75" end="00:10:16.08">But they're also extremely sticky.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:20.92" id="p76" end="00:10:25.04">Mosquitoes emerge in huge<br />numbers from the boggy water</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:25.04" id="p77" end="00:10:27.32">and the sundews are ready.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:59.32" id="p78" end="00:11:03.84">The sundew's tentacles are<br />living fly-paper.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:10.80" id="p79" end="00:11:14.12">Struggling only makes matters worse.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:17.04" id="p80" end="00:11:20.48">With each contact,<br />the plant tightens its grip.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:28.16" id="p81" end="00:11:31.16">As more and more<br />tentacles envelop the prey,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:31.16" id="p82" end="00:11:33.68">the droplets spread<br />across its body.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:37.00" id="p83" end="00:11:41.92">Eventually, the insect is smothered<br />and drowns in sticky fluid.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:43.96" id="p84" end="00:11:48.76">Digestive enzymes break down the<br />body into a nitrogen-rich meal</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:48.76" id="p85" end="00:11:51.16">which is absorbed by the plant.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:51.16" id="p86" end="00:11:55.08">Without animal tissues<br />this plant would not survive.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:00.24" id="p87" end="00:12:02.92">But there's another<br />carnivorous plant</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:02.92" id="p88" end="00:12:06.00">that's an even more<br />sophisticated predator.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:15.12" id="p89" end="00:12:17.80">The Venus fly trap.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:25.16" id="p90" end="00:12:29.12">Like the sundew,<br />it makes itself very attractive,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:29.12" id="p91" end="00:12:32.56">oozing nectar<br />across the brim of each leaf.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:45.08" id="p92" end="00:12:50.56">But any visiting insect had better<br />watch out for these six tiny hairs.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:02.92" id="p93" end="00:13:05.60">This fly has to tread carefully.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:13.00" id="p94" end="00:13:14.64">If it strikes one hair,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:16.28" id="p95" end="00:13:19.04">it can carry on feeding.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:19.04" id="p96" end="00:13:21.72">But a timer has been set.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:29.28" id="p97" end="00:13:34.12">A second strike in less than 20<br />seconds and the fly is doomed.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:42.64" id="p98" end="00:13:49.12">An electrical impulse is triggered<br />and the leaf snaps shut in<br />just a fraction of a second.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:50.72" id="p99" end="00:13:54.80">The tips lock together<br />like prison bars.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:02.36" id="p100" end="00:14:09.04">If the fly is very big, or very<br />small, it may just manage to escape.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:09.04" id="p101" end="00:14:11.08">But most are trapped.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:13.32" id="p102" end="00:14:15.04">And die.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:36.24" id="p103" end="00:14:39.00">Ten days later, the trap re-opens.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:42.36" id="p104" end="00:14:46.92">All that remains is a husk.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:46.92" id="p105" end="00:14:53.04">The plant has finished its meal and<br />resets itself for its next victim.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:56.84" id="p106" end="00:15:00.48">But there is one time of year<br />when the Venus fly trap</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:00.48" id="p107" end="00:15:03.60">needs some of the visiting insects<br />to live.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:04.60" id="p108" end="00:15:08.52">It needs their help<br />to be pollinated.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:08.52" id="p109" end="00:15:12.32">It sends up flowers on tall stems,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:12.32" id="p110" end="00:15:14.80">well away from the<br />danger of the traps below.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:28.48" id="p111" end="00:15:32.72">Here, insects can feed safely<br />on nectar.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:34.24" id="p112" end="00:15:37.16">In return,<br />they provide a vital service,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:37.16" id="p113" end="00:15:39.96">carrying pollen<br />from flower to flower.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:45.16" id="p114" end="00:15:48.80">But the truce is only temporary.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:48.80" id="p115" end="00:15:53.36">When pollination is over,<br />it's back to business as usual.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:03.04" id="p116" end="00:16:06.52">80% of plant species on Earth<br />have flowers.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:09.00" id="p117" end="00:16:11.04">Flowers have just one role -</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:11.04" id="p118" end="00:16:14.32">to enable the plant<br />to produce offspring.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:16.36" id="p119" end="00:16:20.00">Colour, perfume, nectar and shape</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:20.00" id="p120" end="00:16:24.28">all act to make a<br />flower irresistible.</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:46:42.60" id="p409" end="00:46:46.48">Plants have been residents<br />on land longer than animals</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:46:46.48" id="p410" end="00:46:49.80">and have had nearly half a<br />billion years to evolve.</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:57.40" id="p502" end="00:54:01.20">back in the studio - a task<br />that would take weeks to get right.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:18.72" id="p503" end="00:54:22.40">Right under the tree<br />at the end of the rock.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:24.96" id="p504" end="00:54:27.72">Using the detailed measurements<br />taken in the wood,</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:48.28" id="p509" end="00:54:53.88">Chicken-wire and polystyrene form<br />the rocks and trees of the woodland.</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:02.96" id="p512" end="00:55:06.72">Once built, and with the plants<br />placed in their exact locations,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:06.72" id="p513" end="00:55:07.84">filming can start.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:09.64" id="p514" end="00:55:12.64">The stars of the show<br />finally make an appearance.</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:33.72" id="p516" end="00:55:36.60">With each plant taking up<br />to three weeks to flower</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:36.60" id="p517" end="00:55:39.28">there's only one chance<br />of getting it right.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:56:03.60" id="p518" end="00:56:08.56">A year later and thankfully<br />so far all had gone to plan.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:56:15.88" id="p519" end="00:56:20.20">The final stage is to bring all<br />the pieces together seamlessly -</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:56:20.20" id="p520" end="00:56:23.08">a challenging task for any<br />graphic designer.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:56:23.08" id="p521" end="00:56:27.16">We've got things overlapping<br />that wouldn't necessarily grow<br />at the same time,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:56:27.16" id="p522" end="00:56:30.80">but all the growth of each<br />individual plant is<br />absolutely accurate.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:56:30.80" id="p523" end="00:56:32.52">It's exactly what they would do.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:56:32.52" id="p524" end="00:56:35.00">We're just seeing it in a<br />shorter space of time.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:56:35.00" id="p525" end="00:56:40.12">That big rock in the foreground at<br />the end of the shot that we wanted<br />to try and get stuff climbing on,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:56:40.12" id="p526" end="00:56:42.04">that's worked really, really well.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:56:42.04" id="p527" end="00:56:43.68">This is the bramble here.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:56:43.68" id="p528" end="00:56:48.88">Had to measure it so carefully so<br />we knew exactly where these things<br />were, how round they were,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:56:48.88" id="p529" end="00:56:50.68">how deep they were from the camera.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:56:50.68" id="p530" end="00:56:52.88">Then when we take<br />the blue out of that</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:56:52.88" id="p531" end="00:56:55.72">you can see that the plants<br />start to sit into the shot</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:56:55.72" id="p532" end="00:56:57.64">exactly where we wanted them to be,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:56:57.64" id="p533" end="00:56:59.80">things appearing from<br />behind the tree,</p>

      <p style="s3" begin="00:57:03.40" id="p536" end="00:57:04.52">If I switch those off</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:57:04.52" id="p537" end="00:57:07.48">you can see how just how neatly<br />they slot into the shot.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:57:07.48" id="p538" end="00:57:09.84">If we play it, you can see</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:57:09.84" id="p539" end="00:57:14.20">that everything's sticking in<br />pretty well.</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:57:27.68" id="p541" end="00:57:31.24">A 60-second shot that proved<br />to be one of the most complex</p>
