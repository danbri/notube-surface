[[Plant]]s endure a daily struggle for water, nutrients and light. On the forest floor where light is scare, [[time-lapse]] shots show [[ivy|ivies]] and [[Uncaria tomentosa|creeper]]s climbing into the canopy using sticky pads, hooks or coiled tendrils. [[Epiphyte]]s grow directly on the topmost branches of trees. Their bare roots absorb water and trap falling leaves, which provide nutrients as they decompose. Animals can also be a source of food: the [[Drosera|sundew]] traps [[mosquito]]es with sticky fluid, and [[venus flytrap]]s close their clamshell leaves on unwitting insects. Sandhill [[Asclepias|milkweed]] defends itself against feeding [[monarch (butterfly)|monarch]] [[caterpillar]]s by secreting sticky latex from its leaves. The milkweed endures the onslaught because, like most plants, it produces [[flower]]s, and the newly-hatched butterflies [[pollination|pollinate]] them. After flowering, [[brunsvigia]] plants in [[South Africa]] are snapped off by strong winds, sending their seed heads cartwheeling across the ground. [[Saguaro|Saguaro cacti]] produce succulent fruit to attract desert animals which ingest and disperse their seeds. Some plants have adapted to survive environmental extremes. [[Dracaena cinnabari|Dragon's blood tree]]s and desert roses thrive on arid [[Socotra]], and coastal [[mangrove]] trees survive by filtering salt from seawater. [[Bristlecone pine]]s live above 3,000m in [[North America]]â€™s mountains. They have a six-week growing season and can live for 5,000 years, making them the oldest living things on Earth. [[Grass]]es are the most successful of all plants. Of their 10,000 varieties, two cover more land than any other plant: [[rice]] and [[wheat]]. ''Life on Location'' goes behind the scenes of a time-lapse sequence in an English woodland.<ref name=bbc-episode-9>{{cite episode |title=Plants |series=Life |credits=Produced by Neil Lucas |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-12-07|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p90d6}}</ref>
