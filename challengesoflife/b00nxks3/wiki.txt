The sixth episode enters the world of [[insect]]s. By assuming a variety of body shapes and incorporating armour and wings, they have evolved diverse survival strategies and become the most abundant creatures on Earth. In [[Chile]]an [[Patagonia]], male Darwin’s beetles lock horns and hurl their rivals from the treetops in search of a mate. A [[damselfly]]’s chance to mate and lay eggs can be cut abruptly short by a leaping frog. [[Monarch (butterfly)|Monarch butterflies]] use their wings to power them on an epic migration to their hibernating grounds in the forests of [[Mexico]]’s [[Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve|Sierra Madre]]. Many insects carry chemical weapons as a form of defence. High-speed cameras show [[Ground beetle|oogpister beetle]]s squirting [[formic acid]] into the face of an inquisitive [[mongoose]] and [[bombardier beetle]]s firing boiling caustic liquid from their abdomens. Some insects gain an advantage through co-operation. When an [[American black bear]] destroys a [[bee]]’s nest, the colony survives by carrying their honey to a new site. Japanese [[red bug]] nymphs will move to a different nest if their mother fails to provide sufficient food. In the [[Australia]]n outback, male [[Amegilla|Dawson’s bee]]s fight to the death over females emerging from their nest burrows. As a result, all will die, but the strongest mate most often. [[Argentina]]’s [[Atta (genus)|grasscutter ant]]s form huge colonies five million strong. They feed on a [[fungus]] which they cultivate underground, in nest structures which have natural ventilation. ''Life on Location'' documents the Mexico crew’s attempts to rig up aerial camera shots of the awakening monarch butterflies.<ref name=bbc-episode-6>{{cite episode |title=Insects |series=Life |credits=Produced by Rupert Barrington |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-11-16|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nxks3}}</ref>
