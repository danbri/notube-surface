Mammals have adopted diverse strategies to hunt their prey and evade predators. As well as revisiting the cheetah and dolphin hunts first shown in episode one, the programme shows how a sure-footed [[Nubian ibex|ibex]] kid escapes a hunting [[red fox|fox]] by bounding across a precipitous mountainside above the [[Dead Sea]]. Slow motion footage reveals the fishing behaviour of [[greater bulldog bat]]s in [[Belize]] and [[grizzly bear|brown bear]]s at an [[Alaska]]n river mouth, the latter awaiting the return of spawning [[Pacific salmon|salmon]]. The play-fighting of juvenile [[stoat]]s helps train them to run down prey such as [[rabbit]]s, which are many times their own size. The alpha female of an [[Ethiopian wolf]] pack stays at the den to wean her cubs while other adults hunt rats on the highland plateau. The extraordinary nasal appendage of a [[star-nosed mole]] enables it to hunt successfully underground and, by using bubbles to detect its prey, underwater. A [[Bengal tiger|tiger]]â€™s stealthy approach to a group of feeding [[chital]] deer is thwarted when a [[gray langur|langur]], watching from above, raises the alarm. The final sequence shows a female killer whale taking [[Southern elephant seal|elephant seal]] pups from their nursery pool in the [[Falkland Islands]]. This is a risky strategy as she could easily become beached in the shallow water. She is the only killer whale known to hunt this way, but her calf shadows her moves, ensuring her knowledge will be passed on. Also close by were the film crew, who reveal how the sequence was shot for ''Life on Location''.<ref name=bbc-episode-7>{{cite episode |title= Hunters and Hunted |series=Life |credits=Produced by Adam Chapman |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2009-11-23 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p1n00}}</ref>
