      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:28.96" id="p0" end="00:00:31.24">Life is at its most intense</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:31.24" id="p1" end="00:00:35.60">during the struggles<br />between predator and prey.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:39.60" id="p2" end="00:00:42.52">Each side, to survive,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:42.52" id="p3" end="00:00:46.36">must outwit<br />and outmanoeuvre the other.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:49.36" id="p4" end="00:00:51.40">The prize, for the hunter...</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:51.40" id="p5" end="00:00:53.80">a meal.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:53.80" id="p6" end="00:00:58.08">For the prey,<br />the chance to live another day.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:16.32" id="p7" end="00:01:19.04">Three male cheetahs.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:21.76" id="p8" end="00:01:25.04">These brothers are very special.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:28.88" id="p9" end="00:01:33.80">They hunt prey few other cheetahs<br />would dare to tackle.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:41.44" id="p10" end="00:01:45.88">To succeed,<br />they must first select a victim.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:48.24" id="p11" end="00:01:53.12">And then work together<br />to overpower it.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:56.76" id="p12" end="00:01:58.36">It's dangerous work.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:00.36" id="p13" end="00:02:03.76">An adult zebra is<br />potentially lethal.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:09.04" id="p14" end="00:02:12.80">The outcome is by no means certain.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:44.44" id="p15" end="00:02:47.32">The first cheetah is driven off.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:49.04" id="p16" end="00:02:54.16">And his brothers have already<br />made a critical mistake.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:02:54.16" id="p17" end="00:02:57.48">They aren't close enough<br />to take over the attack.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:00.80" id="p18" end="00:03:04.76">Each is chasing a different target,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:04.76" id="p19" end="00:03:08.00">making it easy for<br />the zebra to defend their young.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:19.28" id="p20" end="00:03:23.92">A quarter-tonne stallion finally<br />puts paid to their chances.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:28.60" id="p21" end="00:03:32.68">Chasing different zebra<br />was bound to lead to failure.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:34.56" id="p22" end="00:03:38.16">Perhaps their enthusiasm<br />got the better of them.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:41.56" id="p23" end="00:03:43.60">They must try again.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:52.72" id="p24" end="00:03:57.08">In the shadow of Mount Kenya,<br />the brothers regroup.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:03:59.80" id="p25" end="00:04:04.56">Their mistake with the zebra was<br />to hunt as ordinary cheetahs do -</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:04.56" id="p26" end="00:04:05.88">as individuals.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:09.72" id="p27" end="00:04:14.48">To catch such prey, they must<br />hunt like no other cheetahs.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:17.32" id="p28" end="00:04:20.80">That means acting together,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:20.80" id="p29" end="00:04:22.32">as one.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:30.08" id="p30" end="00:04:31.96">They start again.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:00.20" id="p31" end="00:05:04.20">An ostrich outweighs and outguns<br />a single cheetah.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:11.68" id="p32" end="00:05:14.52">This time there's only one target.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:16.80" id="p33" end="00:05:20.36">And all three cheetahs are onto it.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:25.32" id="p34" end="00:05:28.64">The third brother starts to<br />throttle the ostrich.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:30.32" id="p35" end="00:05:32.48">Even off its feet,<br />it's still dangerous.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:39.32" id="p36" end="00:05:44.84">The brothers have found a unique<br />way of catching their prey.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:50.28" id="p37" end="00:05:53.88">The ability to invent such<br />novel hunting tactics</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:53.88" id="p38" end="00:05:57.12">is one thing<br />that really sets mammals apart.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:05:59.52" id="p39" end="00:06:03.96">But mammals themselves can also<br />be targets for predators,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:03.96" id="p40" end="00:06:08.68">and the hunted also need<br />to devise special tactics.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:19.28" id="p41" end="00:06:23.40">The desert shores of the Dead Sea.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:32.72" id="p42" end="00:06:35.80">Living here is difficult indeed.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:41.00" id="p43" end="00:06:45.64">It's March, and high<br />on these cathedral cliffs,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:45.64" id="p44" end="00:06:49.28">ibex have given birth.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:51.48" id="p45" end="00:06:55.20">For the first few days<br />the kids were kept safe,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:55.20" id="p46" end="00:06:57.48">isolated on the cliff tops.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:06:59.56" id="p47" end="00:07:02.72">But now the ibex have a problem.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:06.00" id="p48" end="00:07:11.08">The only food and water is far<br />below at the bottom of the gorge.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:11.08" id="p49" end="00:07:14.40">And that is where predators lurk.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:15.60" id="p50" end="00:07:19.12">If they're to feed,<br />it's a risk they will have to take.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:24.28" id="p51" end="00:07:27.12">The adults lead the way.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:30.04" id="p52" end="00:07:32.88">They know the safest routes.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:37.80" id="p53" end="00:07:42.04">Though safe, here,<br />is a relative term.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:05.44" id="p54" end="00:08:09.04">The kids have no choice<br />but to keep up.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:24.88" id="p55" end="00:08:28.96">One slip could be the last.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:28.96" id="p56" end="00:08:35.72">Their only assets are cloven hooves<br />that spread under load,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:35.72" id="p57" end="00:08:37.60">astonishing balance...</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:39.68" id="p58" end="00:08:42.72">..and the most uncanny agility.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:46.72" id="p59" end="00:08:50.84">Barely a week old,<br />they are utterly fearless.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:51.80" id="p60" end="00:08:56.12">Learning to negotiate these cliffs<br />is central to their survival.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:12.40" id="p61" end="00:09:16.88">But now the family must be<br />on guard against predators.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:27.04" id="p62" end="00:09:29.92">All grab a chance to browse.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:34.20" id="p63" end="00:09:39.08">Trailing behind,<br />the last youngster is almost down.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:40.60" id="p64" end="00:09:43.40">And runs right into trouble.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:44.60" id="p65" end="00:09:46.24">A fox.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:46.24" id="p66" end="00:09:48.56">It's been waiting for the straggler.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:01.16" id="p67" end="00:10:06.24">The kid has never seen a fox before,<br />but knows it's in real peril.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:15.08" id="p68" end="00:10:18.12">It appears to be running<br />into more trouble,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:18.12" id="p69" end="00:10:20.16">as it heads back up the cliff.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:41.72" id="p70" end="00:10:45.40">The fox tries to<br />gain the higher ground.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:58.72" id="p71" end="00:11:01.24">But the kid has found safety</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:01.24" id="p72" end="00:11:05.92">on a face so steep<br />that only an ibex could stand there.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:18.40" id="p73" end="00:11:22.36">The lessons learnt<br />on this morning's descent</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:22.36" id="p74" end="00:11:24.08">have saved its life.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:25.60" id="p75" end="00:11:28.88">Finally, the fox<br />gives it up as a bad job...</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:31.80" id="p76" end="00:11:36.16">..perhaps suddenly aware<br />it's standing on a precipice.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:38.92" id="p77" end="00:11:40.92">Despite its tender age,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:40.92" id="p78" end="00:11:45.76">the ibex has outwitted<br />one of the canniest of predators.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:52.20" id="p79" end="00:11:57.84">The fox's failure<br />epitomises a predator's plight.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:57.84" id="p80" end="00:12:00.32">Most hunts fail,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:00.32" id="p81" end="00:12:05.28">so hunters are continually<br />devising new tactics.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:12.28" id="p82" end="00:12:16.36">The rainforests of Belize<br />in Central America.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:22.96" id="p83" end="00:12:27.08">And as evening falls<br />and the shower comes to an end,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:27.08" id="p84" end="00:12:30.60">a predator begins to hunt.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:12:59.04" id="p85" end="00:13:01.60">The greater bulldog bat.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:03.16" id="p86" end="00:13:04.76">A flying mammal...</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:06.88" id="p87" end="00:13:08.80">..and a fisherman.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:22.72" id="p88" end="00:13:29.56">A fish swimming just below the<br />surface creates tell-tale ripples</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:29.56" id="p89" end="00:13:33.64">and that is all the bat needs<br />to detect them.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:37.12" id="p90" end="00:13:39.64">With little more than a fin<br />to aim for,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:39.64" id="p91" end="00:13:42.08">and whilst flying at<br />40 miles an hour,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:42.08" id="p92" end="00:13:45.44">the bat takes the fish<br />completely unawares.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:49.28" id="p93" end="00:13:51.56">If the shoal scatters...</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:13:53.76" id="p94" end="00:13:56.84">..the bat trawls the surface.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:03.12" id="p95" end="00:14:07.04">Raking the water,<br />trying to snag a fish.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:18.24" id="p96" end="00:14:22.76">He won't have the best<br />fishing spot to himself for long,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:22.76" id="p97" end="00:14:25.80">and soon, other bats arrive.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:32.92" id="p98" end="00:14:37.72">Oncoming traffic would make<br />grabbing a fish almost impossible,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:37.72" id="p99" end="00:14:41.12">so the bats avoid collisions<br />by honking -</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:14:41.12" id="p100" end="00:14:45.36">dropping their calls an octave<br />to say, "Look out, here I come!"</p>
      <p begin="00:14:45.36" id="p101" end="00:14:48.24">BATS CALL</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:13.24" id="p102" end="00:15:17.24">Soon the shoal has either<br />been captured or has fled,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:17.24" id="p103" end="00:15:19.44">and the bats move on.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:32.88" id="p104" end="00:15:35.48">Skills like this take practice,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:35.48" id="p105" end="00:15:39.96">and for some mammals that<br />practice begins in infancy.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:46.56" id="p106" end="00:15:48.60">A young stoat.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:15:48.60" id="p107" end="00:15:51.68">And it's not alone.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:51.68" id="p108" end="00:15:54.28">STOATS CHIRP</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:02.52" id="p109" end="00:16:06.72">These wild games<br />are too much to resist.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:23.52" id="p110" end="00:16:29.84">Stalking, chasing and ambushing,<br />all practised in play.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:52.76" id="p111" end="00:16:56.80">Soon the young stoats must<br />hunt for themselves,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:16:56.80" id="p112" end="00:17:01.28">and then these athletic skills<br />will be crucial.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:17:16.88" id="p113" end="00:17:20.96">It's September<br />in the English countryside.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:17:23.16" id="p114" end="00:17:28.96">This stoat is about to take on<br />an adversary ten times its size.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:17:34.08" id="p115" end="00:17:37.24">It's too dangerous<br />to rush straight in.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:17:42.52" id="p116" end="00:17:45.96">Instead, the stoat's aim<br />is to wear the rabbit down.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:18:03.32" id="p117" end="00:18:04.72">The rabbit is flagging,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:18:04.72" id="p118" end="00:18:08.16">and the stoat's stamina is<br />starting to make a difference.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:18:15.00" id="p119" end="00:18:17.72">But stamina alone is not enough -</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:18:17.72" id="p120" end="00:18:20.92">the rabbit must still<br />be overpowered.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:47.96" id="p121" end="00:18:50.04">SQUEALING</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:18:57.04" id="p122" end="00:19:00.12">A bite to the back of the neck</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:19:00.12" id="p123" end="00:19:02.00">and a kill.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:19:03.08" id="p124" end="00:19:07.76">The incredible agility of the stoat,<br />practised since it was a kit,</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:19:15.88" id="p126" end="00:19:18.64">There are times when<br />mere physical powers</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:19:18.64" id="p127" end="00:19:21.68">are not enough to give<br />the hunter an edge.</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:19:35.88" id="p130" end="00:19:39.24">a faint hint<br />of a unique hunting tactic.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:19:43.76" id="p131" end="00:19:45.52">The perpetrators...</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:19:47.04" id="p132" end="00:19:49.04">..bottlenose dolphins.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:19:51.56" id="p133" end="00:19:57.36">And they're on a mission -<br />a mission to catch fish.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:19:57.36" id="p134" end="00:20:00.32">The fish here<br />are very difficult to catch</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:20:00.32" id="p135" end="00:20:03.68">and in such shallow water<br />they ought to be safe.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:20:08.56" id="p136" end="00:20:11.84">Yet the dolphins have a plan.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:20:22.16" id="p137" end="00:20:24.68">They have learnt to corral the fish</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:20:24.68" id="p138" end="00:20:26.24">by working as a team.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:20:34.32" id="p139" end="00:20:38.60">The lead dolphin beats its tail<br />on the sea bed,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:20:38.60" id="p140" end="00:20:40.76">stirring up a ring of mud.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:20:42.28" id="p141" end="00:20:46.04">Trapped inside, the fish<br />take their only way out,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:20:46.04" id="p142" end="00:20:50.68">but they're leaping out of<br />the frying pan and into the fire.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:21:00.52" id="p143" end="00:21:05.04">Once the mud ring loses its shape,<br />the fish scatter.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:21:05.04" id="p144" end="00:21:09.32">The dolphins move on<br />and repeat the process.</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:21:22.56" id="p146" end="00:21:25.16">it's a winning formula.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:21:47.64" id="p147" end="00:21:53.28">This behaviour is unique to<br />the dolphins of Florida Bay.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:21:54.48" id="p148" end="00:21:58.12">Successive generations have<br />learnt it from their parents</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:22:17.52" id="p150" end="00:22:21.48">The ability to pass on<br />such complex behaviours</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:22:21.48" id="p151" end="00:22:24.96">is one of the mammals'<br />greatest talents.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:22:24.96" id="p152" end="00:22:29.24">It enables them to survive<br />where others would perish.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:22:50.88" id="p153" end="00:22:56.52">As winter approaches in Alaska, food<br />gets progressively harder to find.</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:24:15.56" id="p164" end="00:24:19.40">these bears have the first chance.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:24:46.40" id="p165" end="00:24:51.88">Each bear's survival depends on<br />this run of fish staying strong.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:25:05.60" id="p166" end="00:25:10.40">There are years when their gamble<br />fails and the fish hardly show.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:25:10.40" id="p167" end="00:25:13.08">Then the bears face starvation.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:25:23.48" id="p168" end="00:25:27.08">This year promises to<br />be a bumper one</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:25:27.08" id="p169" end="00:25:31.24">and the bears will be able to<br />pile on the pounds ahead of winter.</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:26:00.84" id="p173" end="00:26:06.52">But for some predators, conditions<br />are tough whatever the time of year.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:26:14.76" id="p174" end="00:26:20.48">At first glance, these mountains<br />seem barren and empty of life.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:26:22.00" id="p175" end="00:26:25.12">Like islands thrust up into the sky,</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:26:53.12" id="p180" end="00:26:55.44">The Ethiopian wolf.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:26:55.44" id="p181" end="00:26:59.28">The only wolf in<br />the whole of Africa.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:27:14.60" id="p182" end="00:27:19.44">Despite being close to the equator,<br />these peaks are so cold at night</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:27:27.80" id="p184" end="00:27:32.16">Each pack is centred around<br />a single dominant female.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:27:32.16" id="p185" end="00:27:35.12">Normally it is only she who breeds.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:27:39.88" id="p186" end="00:27:43.80">This year she has produced six pups.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:27:43.80" id="p187" end="00:27:46.92">But if she is to raise them all<br />in this barren land,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:27:46.92" id="p188" end="00:27:50.32">she will need the help<br />of the entire pack.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:27:55.80" id="p189" end="00:28:00.20">Every morning,<br />the pack sets off to hunt,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:28:00.20" id="p190" end="00:28:04.92">leaving her back among the rocks<br />with the pups.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:28:11.48" id="p191" end="00:28:16.84">The pack's hunting ground is about<br />five square miles of mountain top.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:28:25.84" id="p192" end="00:28:28.16">They guard it zealously,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:28:28.16" id="p193" end="00:28:30.96">patrolling its frontiers every day.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:28:34.56" id="p194" end="00:28:36.88">Wolves elsewhere co-operate</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:28:36.88" id="p195" end="00:28:40.56">and use their united power<br />to pull down big prey.</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:28:50.88" id="p197" end="00:28:53.92">The pack splits up.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:28:53.92" id="p198" end="00:28:57.04">Each member is going to hunt alone.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:28:59.44" id="p199" end="00:29:01.40">One of them spots something.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:29:28.60" id="p200" end="00:29:30.60">It's a rat.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:30:12.56" id="p201" end="00:30:18.04">But catching rats is not easy, no<br />matter how carefully you stalk them.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:30:21.56" id="p202" end="00:30:25.48">Another hunter has<br />a more pro-active technique.</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:30:27.56" id="p204" end="00:30:28.80">And that works.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:30:37.16" id="p205" end="00:30:40.88">It's a lot of work for<br />relatively small rewards,</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:31:20.88" id="p210" end="00:31:24.24">So rearing a single litter here</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:31:24.24" id="p211" end="00:31:27.52">takes the combined labour<br />of a dozen or so adults</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:31:27.52" id="p212" end="00:31:32.16">and the Ethiopian wolves<br />have adjusted their behaviour<br />accordingly.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:31:39.08" id="p213" end="00:31:43.04">That adaptability is<br />the mammals' great strength,</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:32:26.24" id="p219" end="00:32:30.64">It enables it to detect food<br />with astonishing speed.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:32:53.12" id="p220" end="00:32:55.44">It can also swim...</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:33:19.76" id="p222" end="00:33:23.68">It blows out a bubble<br />and breathes it back in,</p>

      <p style="s1" begin="00:51:33.84" id="p385" end="00:51:36.68">when suddenly<br />the killer whales arrive.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:51:44.00" id="p386" end="00:51:47.84">The pod of nine is clearly<br />interested in the pool,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:51:47.84" id="p387" end="00:51:50.48">and one female is<br />particularly confident.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:50.48" id="p388" end="00:51:52.20">She's coming in.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:52:13.84" id="p389" end="00:52:18.40">The female and her calf start<br />to come into the pool regularly,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:52:18.40" id="p390" end="00:52:21.00">but there never seems to be<br />a pup within reach.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:52:26.88" id="p391" end="00:52:31.12">The team have come to the Falklands<br />prepared to film underwater.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:52:31.12" id="p392" end="00:52:34.92">Now the time has come to see<br />if this is a realistic ambition.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:34.92" id="p393" end="00:52:36.32">SEAL EXHALES</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:52:39.84" id="p394" end="00:52:45.12">With lookouts posted and the whales<br />far away, Mike is able to get in.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:52:49.48" id="p395" end="00:52:52.28">Even so,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:52:52.28" id="p396" end="00:52:54.68">who can blame him for being jumpy?</p>
      <p begin="00:52:54.68" id="p397" end="00:52:55.72">Ah!</p>
      <p begin="00:53:00.60" id="p398" end="00:53:01.88">Whoo!</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:01.88" id="p399" end="00:53:06.76">The pups' playfulness is becoming an<br />issue - the last thing the team want</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:06.76" id="p400" end="00:53:09.96">is to have any influence<br />on the events they're here to film.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:17.68" id="p401" end="00:53:22.20">There's also the question of<br />how the killer whales might react</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:22.20" id="p402" end="00:53:24.00">to a person in the water.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:27.68" id="p403" end="00:53:30.28">It's quite intimidating in there.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:30.28" id="p404" end="00:53:33.80">It shelves up, so I'm in the centre<br />of the channel and it goes down to,</p>
      <p begin="00:53:33.80" id="p405" end="00:53:37.00">I don't know, maybe eight feet<br />I think, a couple of metres.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:37.00" id="p406" end="00:53:39.16">But the visibility's<br />really stirred up.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:39.16" id="p407" end="00:53:42.72">How they find their way in<br />that channel I just don't know.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:42.72" id="p408" end="00:53:46.32">And what I'm worried about<br />is if I do get in the water<br />with the orca...</p>
      <p begin="00:53:47.84" id="p409" end="00:53:50.76">Which I'm slightly concerned about,<br />I have to say...</p>
      <p begin="00:53:50.76" id="p410" end="00:53:54.56">She's in a hunting mode,<br />she's not here just for her</p>
      <p begin="00:53:54.56" id="p411" end="00:53:59.12">to pass the time of day.<br />She's out there to kill something,</p>
      <p begin="00:53:59.12" id="p412" end="00:54:03.04">and, you know, I just don't want<br />to be that person, or seal...</p>
      <p begin="00:54:03.04" id="p413" end="00:54:04.36">Whatever she thinks I am.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:04.36" id="p414" end="00:54:08.80">She'll probably realise once she's<br />bitten me that she's made a mistake</p>
      <p begin="00:54:08.80" id="p415" end="00:54:12.84">and, I don't know,<br />is it worth the gamble? <span tts:color="lime">No. </span>No.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:12.84" id="p416" end="00:54:14.72">With a week already gone,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:14.72" id="p417" end="00:54:19.00">the killer whales have not<br />yet made a full-blown attack,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:19.00" id="p418" end="00:54:22.56">and then the weather changes.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:22.56" id="p419" end="00:54:25.56">Well, hopefully it'll blow<br />itself out but I think...</p>
      <p begin="00:54:25.56" id="p420" end="00:54:30.52">The pool, it's going to be a couple<br />of days before that calms down.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:30.52" id="p421" end="00:54:33.12">The storm rages for two more days,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:33.12" id="p422" end="00:54:37.00">but on the eleventh day<br />the good weather returns.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:39.32" id="p423" end="00:54:42.52">Mike knows that time is running out.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:42.52" id="p424" end="00:54:46.24">Well, the orcas are out there,<br />they're still quite a way off.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:46.24" id="p425" end="00:54:49.04">The team decides a camera<br />on the end of a pole</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:54:49.04" id="p426" end="00:54:52.32">might be the way to reveal<br />the underwater action.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:52.32" id="p427" end="00:54:54.96">After that storm,<br />it's been so stirred up.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:57.64" id="p428" end="00:55:01.16">And just... Just bring it slightly<br />out of the water, Adam,</p>
      <p begin="00:55:01.16" id="p429" end="00:55:03.84">so draw it back towards you and stop.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:06.92" id="p430" end="00:55:11.52">And it's dark, dark, green,<br />basically, very dark green.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:55:11.52" id="p431" end="00:55:14.00">There's still a lot of...</p>
      <p begin="00:55:14.00" id="p432" end="00:55:15.28">Suspension, yeah.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:15.28" id="p433" end="00:55:18.28">The storm had stirred up the pool</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:18.28" id="p434" end="00:55:23.04">making it hard to see anything,<br />but the team remain in good spirits.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:55:23.04" id="p435" end="00:55:25.40">Does my bum look big in this?</p>
      <p begin="00:55:25.40" id="p436" end="00:55:28.12">Massive!</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:28.12" id="p437" end="00:55:31.00">As the seal pups are nearly<br />ready to go to sea,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:31.00" id="p438" end="00:55:34.88">the whales' opportunity<br />to hunt this year will soon pass</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:55:34.88" id="p439" end="00:55:38.60">and the team know<br />this could be their last chance.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:38.60" id="p440" end="00:55:40.84">Look at the size of that fin!</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:55:45.36" id="p441" end="00:55:47.80">OK, Mike, she's coming in.</p>

      <p style="s3" begin="00:55:50.36" id="p443" end="00:55:53.04">Just here.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:55:53.04" id="p444" end="00:55:54.56">Mike?</p>
      <p begin="00:55:56.68" id="p445" end="00:55:58.36">One second, mate.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:01.56" id="p446" end="00:56:03.92">I can talk to you gently here now</p>
      <p begin="00:56:03.92" id="p447" end="00:56:07.56">and I can also see<br />where you're pointing.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:56:07.56" id="p448" end="00:56:08.96">She's in.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:11.48" id="p449" end="00:56:14.72">I'm recording.<br />Hold it steady, hold it steady.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:25.68" id="p450" end="00:56:27.20">I got it.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:56:35.20" id="p451" end="00:56:37.12">She's gone past, Mike,<br />she's in the pool.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:37.12" id="p452" end="00:56:38.60">OK, get in there.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:47.24" id="p453" end="00:56:49.92">She's got one, definitely,<br />you can't mistake it.</p>
      <p begin="00:56:53.72" id="p454" end="00:56:56.40">Bringing it out now.<br /><span tts:color="cyan">Taking it straight out.</span></p>
      <p begin="00:56:58.52" id="p455" end="00:57:00.04">She's pulling it out.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:07.60" id="p456" end="00:57:10.12">Out to sea...</p>
      <p begin="00:57:13.04" id="p457" end="00:57:14.56">Taking it under.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:16.92" id="p458" end="00:57:19.04">God, he just got hammered.</p>
      <p begin="00:57:21.20" id="p459" end="00:57:24.72">Part of me's elated that I've got it,<br />but part of me's sad, really,</p>
      <p begin="00:57:24.72" id="p460" end="00:57:29.32">cos I've watched these<br />little characters, these pups<br />grow in the last few weeks</p>
      <p begin="00:57:29.32" id="p461" end="00:57:31.60">and the orcas too,<br />they've got to survive</p>
      <p begin="00:57:31.60" id="p462" end="00:57:34.24">and they've made a successful hunt</p>
      <p begin="00:57:34.24" id="p463" end="00:57:39.60">and they're now continuing<br />their journey, so what can you say?</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:57:40.60" id="p464" end="00:57:45.48">Witnessing such events often results<br />in such a conflict of emotions.</p>
